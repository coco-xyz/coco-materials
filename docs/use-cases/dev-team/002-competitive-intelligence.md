## Scenario

**Who:** A tech lead or CTO who needs to understand the competitive landscape and identify feature gaps.

**Problem:** Competitive analysis traditionally requires days of manual research — reading docs, comparing features, mapping gaps. By the time you finish, the landscape has shifted.

**Solution:** Use Zylos to instantly research competitors, benchmark features, and produce a structured requirements database with priority-ranked gaps and differentiation opportunities.

## Demo / Walkthrough

### Step 1: Request competitive analysis
Tell your AI: "Create a requirements database benchmarking against [Competitor]. Identify feature gaps."

### Step 2: AI researches and analyzes
The agent automatically:
- Searches competitor documentation, GitHub, community forums
- Maps features across 13+ categories
- Identifies gaps and assigns priority levels (P0/P1/P2)
- Highlights your existing advantages

### Step 3: Structured output delivered
You get a complete requirements document:
- 13 categories, 40+ individual requirements
- Priority levels (P0 = critical gap, P1 = important, P2 = nice-to-have)
- Your advantages vs competitor's strengths
- Actionable roadmap priorities
