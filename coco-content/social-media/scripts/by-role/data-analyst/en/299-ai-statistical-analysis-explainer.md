# #299 - AI Statistical Analysis Explainer — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Data Analyst / Analysis
**Metric**: 87% of analytics projects fail to reach production → COCO bridges the understanding gap

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: Analyst presenting a regression table to executives; blank stares; executive says "interesting, can you send this to the team?" — nothing changes
[Voiceover]: "You ran the analysis. Nobody understood it. Nothing got decided."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Split screen — left: dense statistical output (p-values, beta coefficients, AUC curves); right: executive shrugging, product manager saying "what does this mean for our roadmap?"
[Voiceover]: "87% of analytics projects fail to reach production. Not because the analysis was wrong — because non-technical stakeholders couldn't evaluate it. Analysts are trained in pandas and Tableau. Not in translating a beta coefficient of 0.34 into a decision."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: Analyst pastes regression output into COCO; a plain-language interpretation appears for three different audiences — executive, product manager, technical peer; assumption check code generates; effect size calculated in business terms
[Voiceover]: "COCO translates your statistical output into plain language calibrated to each audience, checks your assumptions before you publish results, and tells you whether your significant finding is actually significant for the business."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: Analyst presents; executive says "got it — let's test the onboarding change"; decision logged; analysis reaches production
[Voiceover]: "48% higher stakeholder comprehension. 3x faster decisions. Analysis that actually gets used — Try COCO at coco.xyz"
