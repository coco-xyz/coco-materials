## Social Media Copy

We evaluated 47 vendors last year for various procurement needs. Each evaluation involved: collecting proposals (2-3 weeks of back-and-forth), building comparison matrices (4-6 hours per evaluation), checking references (3-4 calls per vendor), reviewing contracts (2-3 hours per contract with legal), and scoring against our evaluation criteria. Total effort per major vendor evaluation: 40-60 hours across procurement, legal, and the business unit.

The worst part wasn't the time -- it was the inconsistency. Different evaluators weighted criteria differently. Some vendors looked better because they had a better slide deck, not a better product. And by the time we finished the evaluation, the business had already informally picked their favorite based on the demo they liked most.

One vendor selection went wrong last year. A $180K/year HR platform that looked great on paper but had 68% implementation failure rate -- information we would have found if we'd systematically analyzed their Glassdoor reviews, G2 ratings, and reference patterns instead of relying on the 3 cherry-picked references they provided.

COCO's AI Vendor Evaluator brought rigor and speed to every evaluation:
- Generates standardized RFPs from your requirements, ensuring no criteria is missed
- Analyzes vendor proposals against a consistent scoring framework -- no more subjective "I liked their team"
- Cross-references vendor claims with G2 reviews, Glassdoor data, financial filings, and customer references
- Performs contract comparison: highlights non-standard terms, missing SLAs, and hidden cost escalators
- Risk assessment: financial stability, customer concentration, litigation history, key person dependency

Evaluation time: from 50 hours to 8 hours. Vendor selection accuracy (measured by 2-year satisfaction): from 64% to 89%. That HR platform debacle? Would have been flagged with a 37/100 risk score.

## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Vendor Evaluation Is Slow, Subjective, and Risky**

Vendor selection is one of the highest-stakes procurement decisions -- and one of the most poorly executed. A bad vendor selection doesn't just waste budget; it creates operational disruption, implementation failures, contract disputes, and sometimes years of lock-in to an inadequate solution.

The root causes are systemic. Evaluation processes are manual and inconsistent. Different stakeholders evaluate vendors using different criteria, different weights, and different levels of rigor. The vendor with the best presentation often wins over the vendor with the best product. Reference checks are theater -- vendors provide their happiest customers, not a representative sample.

Most critically, available intelligence about vendors goes unanalyzed. G2 and Capterra have thousands of verified reviews. Glassdoor reveals implementation and support quality. SEC filings show financial stability. Job postings reveal strategic direction. Court records show litigation patterns. All of this data exists but nobody has time to synthesize it during a procurement cycle.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Vendor Evaluator standardizes, accelerates, and deepens the vendor evaluation process.

1. **RFP Generation**: Creates comprehensive, requirement-aligned RFPs that ensure:
   - All functional requirements captured from stakeholder input
   - Non-functional requirements included (security, compliance, scalability)
   - Evaluation criteria and scoring methodology defined upfront
   - Standard format that makes vendor responses comparable

2. **Proposal Analysis**: When vendor proposals come in, COCO:
   - Extracts and normalizes responses against each requirement
   - Identifies requirements that are fully met, partially met, or not addressed
   - Compares pricing structures (accounting for different pricing models)
   - Flags vague or non-committal responses
   - Generates a side-by-side comparison matrix

3. **Independent Vendor Intelligence**: Beyond what vendors tell you, COCO researches:
   - **Customer Reviews**: G2, Capterra, TrustRadius -- sentiment analysis and common complaints
   - **Employee Reviews**: Glassdoor themes about product quality, support, and company stability
   - **Financial Health**: Revenue trends, funding, profitability indicators
   - **Market Position**: Analyst reports, market share, competitive trajectory
   - **Risk Indicators**: Litigation, data breaches, key executive departures, customer churn signals

4. **Contract Analysis**: COCO reviews vendor contracts and flags:
   - Non-standard terms that deviate from your preferred contract template
   - Missing SLAs or SLAs below your requirements
   - Auto-renewal clauses and termination restrictions
   - Hidden cost escalators (annual price increases, overage charges)
   - Data ownership, portability, and deletion obligations
   - Liability caps and indemnification gaps

5. **Scoring and Recommendation**: COCO produces a defensible evaluation:
   - Weighted scoring across all criteria (functional, technical, financial, risk)
   - Sensitivity analysis (how does the ranking change if weights change?)
   - Clear recommendation with justification
   - Dissenting factors (areas where the recommended vendor is weak)

6. **Vendor Risk Scoring**: Each vendor gets a risk score (0-100) based on:
   - Financial stability and runway
   - Customer concentration (are they dependent on a few large customers?)
   - Implementation success rate (from reviews and references)
   - Support quality indicators
   - Key person dependency
   - Technology platform maturity

**Measurable Results**

- **Evaluation time**: From 50 hours to 8 hours per vendor selection (84% reduction)
- **Vendor selection accuracy**: From 64% to 89% (2-year satisfaction)
- **Cost savings from better negotiation**: 12% average on contract value (better intelligence = stronger position)
- **Procurement cycle time**: From 8 weeks to 3 weeks
- **Risk incidents from vendor issues**: Down 71% (better due diligence)
- **Evaluation consistency**: Standardized scoring eliminated subjective variance

**Who Benefits**

- **Procurement Teams**: Faster, more rigorous evaluations with defensible recommendations
- **Business Stakeholders**: Clearer comparison of options aligned to their requirements
- **Legal**: Contract risks identified before negotiation, not during disputes
- **Finance**: Better cost comparisons, fewer surprise cost escalations
- **Leadership**: Confidence that vendor selections are data-driven, not politics-driven

## Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Generate Vendor Evaluation Scorecard**
```
Create a vendor evaluation scorecard for selecting a [type of vendor/solution].

Our requirements:
- Functional: [list key functional requirements]
- Technical: [list technical requirements: integrations, security, scalability]
- Commercial: [budget range, pricing model preference, contract length]
- Support: [SLA requirements, support hours, implementation assistance]

Vendors to evaluate:
1. [Vendor A]: [brief description]
2. [Vendor B]: [brief description]
3. [Vendor C]: [brief description]

Generate:
1. Evaluation criteria (15-20 items across categories: functional, technical, commercial, support, risk)
2. Weighting for each criterion (total = 100%)
3. Scoring rubric (1-5 scale with specific definitions per score)
4. Must-have vs. nice-to-have classification
5. Red flags that should disqualify a vendor
6. Data sources to check for each vendor (reviews, financials, references)
7. Blank scorecard template ready to fill in
```

**Prompt 2: Analyze and Compare Vendor Proposals**
```
Compare these vendor proposals against our requirements and rank them.

Our requirements:
[paste or summarize key requirements with priorities]

Vendor A proposal:
[paste key sections or summarize]

Vendor B proposal:
[paste key sections or summarize]

Vendor C proposal:
[paste key sections or summarize]

Analyze:
1. Requirements coverage matrix (which vendor meets which requirements)
2. Pricing comparison (normalize for different pricing models: per user, per transaction, flat fee)
3. Total cost of ownership over [3/5 years] including implementation, training, support, and estimated growth
4. Strengths and weaknesses of each vendor
5. Risk assessment per vendor (financial stability, market position, support quality)
6. Missing information to request from each vendor before deciding
7. Recommendation with justification
```

**Prompt 3: Vendor Contract Risk Analysis**
```
Review this vendor contract and identify risks, non-standard terms, and negotiation opportunities.

Contract:
[paste contract text or key sections]

Our standard requirements:
- SLA: [our minimum SLA requirements]
- Data: [data ownership, portability, deletion requirements]
- Termination: [our preferred termination terms]
- Liability: [our minimum liability/indemnification expectations]
- Pricing: [our expectations on price escalation caps]

Analyze:
1. **Non-standard terms**: Clauses that deviate from typical market terms
2. **Missing protections**: SLAs, data rights, or obligations that should be included but aren't
3. **Hidden costs**: Auto-renewal traps, overage charges, price escalation clauses
4. **Termination risks**: Lock-in provisions, exit penalties, data extraction limitations
5. **Liability gaps**: Where liability caps or indemnification may be insufficient
6. **Negotiation priorities**: Top 5 terms to push back on, with suggested alternative language

Present as a redline summary that I can share with legal.
```

**Prompt 4: Vendor Risk Assessment**
```
Perform a risk assessment for [Vendor Name] as a potential critical supplier.

Information available:
- Company background: [what you know - size, age, funding, ownership]
- Product: [what they sell, who their customers are]
- Reviews: [G2/Capterra ratings if known]
- Financial: [any financial information available]
- Contract value to us: $[X]/year

Assess risk across dimensions:
1. **Financial risk**: Can they sustain operations? Signs of financial distress?
2. **Operational risk**: Implementation success rate, support quality, uptime history
3. **Strategic risk**: Are they being acquired? Pivoting away from our use case? Losing market share?
4. **Concentration risk**: How dependent are they on a few customers? How dependent would we be on them?
5. **Security/compliance risk**: Data handling, certifications, breach history
6. **Key person risk**: Is the company dependent on specific individuals?

Overall risk score (0-100) with justification and recommended mitigation for each high-risk area.
