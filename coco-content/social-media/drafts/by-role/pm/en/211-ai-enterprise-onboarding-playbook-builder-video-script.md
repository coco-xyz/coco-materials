# Video Script: AI Enterprise Onboarding Playbook Builder
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "A six-figure contract is signed. The customer is handed off from sales to CS. And immediately it falls apart — their IT team has compliance questions nobody documented, their admin needs configuration help the CSM has never done before, and implementation is 3 to 5 times longer than scoped."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows a CSM improvising from a two-year-old generic onboarding doc, right side shows a 90-day onboarding dragging into month five. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "Enterprise onboarding that drags past 90 days correlates with 40% higher year-one churn. Customers who miss the 30-day first-value milestone are 3x more likely to reduce at renewal. The product works — the onboarding doesn't."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Client segment profiling classifying each customer by complexity tier — Standard, Complex, Regulated, Multi-Entity — before day one begins
  - Phase-by-phase workflow generation with sequenced milestones, task owners, success criteria, and customer-side accountability for each phase
  - Risk register with early warning indicators and mitigation paths for the most common onboarding failure modes per customer profile
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Enterprise Onboarding Playbook Builder creates tailored implementation workflows that reduce onboarding duration by 30-40% and accelerate time-to-first-value from 60+ days to under 30."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "CSM ramp time cut from 10 weeks to 5. Onboarding NPS improves 20-30 points. Escalations during onboarding reduced by 45% through proactive risk identification. Customers on structured playbooks show 28% lower churn at 12 months."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
