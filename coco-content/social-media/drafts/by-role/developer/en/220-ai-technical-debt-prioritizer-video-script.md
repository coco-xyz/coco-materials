# Video Script: AI Technical Debt Prioritizer
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "Your team knows technical debt exists. When asked 'how bad is it?', the best answer is a vague gesture at 400 Jira tickets labeled 'cleanup.' Industry data shows debt absorbs 20-40% of development capacity in mature codebases. For a 20-engineer team, that's 4-8 engineers effectively working on debt service instead of product."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows developers carefully navigating around high-debt modules, right side shows random refactoring consuming weeks with limited strategic impact. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "Technical debt's most dangerous quality is invisibility. Without quantification there's no prioritization, and without prioritization, teams either do nothing — letting debt compound — or refactor randomly, producing effort without strategic impact. You can't defend a budget for work you can't measure."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Automated codebase scanning combining Git churn hotspots, static analysis output, and change frequency to identify high-risk debt patterns
  - Business-impact scoring using (Impact × Defect Probability) / Remediation Effort to surface high-ROI fixes first, not just "biggest problem" first
  - Dual output: engineering view with specific files and functions, executive view with velocity drag, defect risk, and refactoring ROI — ready for budget conversations
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Technical Debt Prioritizer scores 100% of your codebase in a first run — focusing engineering time on debt that actually moves the needle on velocity and defect rates."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "Addressing top-priority debt zones reduces bug reports in those areas by 40-60% within 2 sprints. Teams achieve 3x more velocity improvement per engineering-hour vs. random refactoring. Sprint planning debt discussions cut from 90 minutes to 20 — because the backlog is pre-prioritized."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
