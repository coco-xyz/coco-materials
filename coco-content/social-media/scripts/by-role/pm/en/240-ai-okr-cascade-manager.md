# #240 - AI OKR Cascade Manager — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Product Manager / Analysis
**Metric**: 3 weeks OKR drafting → 8 days, 58% improvement in OKR quality review pass rate

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: A planning doc with a company OKR at top and team OKRs below — all the team OKRs basically restate the company OKR word-for-word
[Voiceover]: "If your team's OKRs look like a copy of the company OKRs with smaller numbers — they're not OKRs. They're theater."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: A PM in a planning meeting, three screens of OKR docs open, looking overwhelmed; cut to an end-of-quarter review where someone says "we technically hit the KR but nothing changed for customers"
[Voiceover]: "78% of companies use OKRs. Only 31% of PMs can actually explain how their team's goals connect to company strategy. The rest are writing output metrics dressed up as outcomes — and nobody finds out until the quarter is over and nothing moved."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: COCO taking company OKRs as input and generating team-level OKRs with specific metrics, baselines, and cascade rationale; then flagging two teams' OKRs as contradictory before they're submitted
[Voiceover]: "COCO translates company OKRs into team-level goals that are genuinely operational — with specific metrics, baselines, and cascade rationale. It flags when two teams' OKRs are pulling in opposite directions before the quarter starts, and tells you mid-quarter which numbers are real and which ones to worry about."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: A clean OKR review session where every KR is clearly connected to company strategy; a PM nodding confidently
[Voiceover]: "58% higher OKR quality. 8-day planning cycle instead of 3 weeks. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
