## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Manual Expense Auditing Is Slow, Incomplete, and Expensive**

Expense report auditing is one of those necessary finance functions that everyone knows is broken but nobody fixes. The process is labor-intensive, error-prone, and still misses significant policy violations and fraud. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners estimates that organizations lose 5% of revenue to fraud, with expense reimbursement fraud being one of the most common types.

Manual auditing has a fundamental sampling problem. When reviewing 1,200 reports takes 160 hours, finance teams resort to sampling -- auditing 20-30% of reports in detail and rubber-stamping the rest. This means 70-80% of expense reports receive minimal scrutiny, creating a known vulnerability that sophisticated bad actors exploit.

The errors aren't just fraud. Honest mistakes are rampant: employees who don't know the policy, receipts that don't match claimed amounts due to currency conversion, duplicate submissions from confusing expense systems, and miscategorized expenses that distort departmental budgets. These errors, individually small, compound into material financial inaccuracies.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Expense Auditor provides 100% audit coverage with consistent policy enforcement.

1. **Receipt Processing**: OCR reads receipt images in any format -- paper scans, phone photos, PDF downloads, even screenshots. Extracts vendor name, date, amount, tax, and category. Cross-references against the claimed values. Flags mismatches with the exact discrepancy amount.

2. **Policy Compliance Engine**: Checks every line item against your full expense policy:
   - Meal limits (per person, per event, by meal type)
   - Hotel rate caps (by city tier, season, advance booking)
   - Flight booking windows (advance purchase requirements, class restrictions)
   - Entertainment policies (client presence required, per-event limits, description requirements)
   - Mileage rates (IRS standard vs. company rate, route verification)
   - Per diem rules (domestic vs. international, city-specific rates)
   - Approval thresholds (who needs to approve at each dollar level)

3. **Pattern Detection**: Identifies suspicious patterns across time and across submitters:
   - **Split transactions**: Breaking a $300 dinner into two $150 receipts to stay below the $200 approval limit
   - **Round numbers**: Too many expenses at exactly $50, $100, $75 -- likely estimates rather than actuals
   - **Weekend/holiday anomalies**: Expenses on non-work days without corresponding travel authorization
   - **Vendor frequency**: Same restaurant 15 times in a month raises questions
   - **Threshold gaming**: 8 out of 10 expenses at $49 when the receipt requirement starts at $50
   - **Cross-employee patterns**: Two employees claiming the same dinner on different reports

4. **Risk Scoring**: Each expense report gets a risk score (0-100):
   - **0-20**: Clean, auto-approve
   - **21-50**: Minor issues, auto-approve with notation
   - **51-75**: Review recommended (specific items flagged with policy citations)
   - **76-100**: High risk, mandatory human review with full analysis attached

5. **Smart Routing**: Based on risk score and issue type:
   - Clean reports: Auto-approved, no human touch needed
   - Medium-risk: Flagged items sent to submitter for clarification before approval
   - High-risk: Escalated to finance manager with full analysis, policy citations, and historical context

6. **Reporting and Analytics**: Monthly and quarterly dashboards:
   - Policy compliance rates by department, team, and individual
   - Top violation types and trends over time
   - Estimated cost savings from fraud prevention and error correction
   - Department-level spending patterns and budget impact
   - Recommendations for policy updates based on common edge cases

**Measurable Results**

- **Policy violation detection**: From 60% to 97%
- **Processing time per report**: From 8 minutes to 12 seconds
- **Finance team time saved**: 150+ hours/month reallocated to strategic work
- **Fraudulent expenses caught**: $180K in first year (previously undetected)
- **Average reimbursement turnaround**: From 8 days to 2 days
- **False positive rate**: Under 5% (minimizing unnecessary human reviews)
- **Policy compliance awareness**: 40% reduction in violations after employees learned every report is audited

**Who Benefits**

- **Finance/AP Teams**: 95% time savings on audit; focus shifts from receipt reading to financial strategy
- **Controllers**: Confidence that every expense is policy-compliant; cleaner audit trails
- **Employees**: Faster reimbursement (2 days vs. 8); clear feedback on policy violations
- **CFO**: Material reduction in fraud risk; better spending visibility; cleaner financials
- **Compliance Officers**: 100% audit coverage satisfies regulatory and internal audit requirements

## Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Audit Expense Report**
```
Audit this expense report against our company policy.

Our expense policy:
- Meals: Max $75/person for client meals, $25 for individual meals
- Hotels: Max $250/night domestic, $350/night international
- Flights: Must book 14+ days in advance for discount; economy class unless flight >6 hours
- Ground transportation: Uber/Lyft approved; rental car requires pre-approval
- Entertainment: Max $200/event, requires client names in description
- Receipts required for all expenses over $25

Expense report:
[paste expense line items with dates, amounts, categories, descriptions]

For each line item:
1. Policy compliance: Pass / Flag (cite specific policy rule)
2. Receipt match: Verified / Missing / Mismatch
3. Anomaly check: Normal / Suspicious (explain why)
4. Risk score for overall report (0-100)
5. Recommendation: Auto-approve / Human review required / Reject
```

**Prompt 2: Build Expense Fraud Detection Rules**
```
Design fraud detection rules for our expense reimbursement system.

Our company: [size, industry]
Monthly expense reports: ~[X]
Common expense categories: [list]
Current known issues: [describe any known fraud patterns]

Create detection rules for:
1. **Split transaction detection**: Expenses split to stay below approval limits
2. **Round number alerting**: Too many round-number expenses (likely estimates)
3. **Weekend/holiday anomalies**: Expenses on non-work days without travel
4. **Vendor frequency**: Same vendor appearing unusually often
5. **Threshold gaming**: Expenses clustering just below approval thresholds
6. **Ghost employees**: Expense submissions from terminated or non-existent employees
7. **Duplicate submissions**: Same expense claimed twice
8. **Lifestyle mismatch**: Expense patterns inconsistent with role/travel requirements

For each rule: trigger condition, severity level, false positive mitigation, and recommended action.
```

**Prompt 3: Expense Policy Review and Update**
```
Review our current expense policy and recommend updates based on common issues.

Current policy:
[paste your current expense policy]

Common violations and edge cases we've seen:
[describe recurring issues, gray areas, frequently asked questions]

Analyze and provide:
1. **Policy gaps**: What situations aren't covered that should be?
2. **Unclear language**: Which rules are ambiguous or open to interpretation?
3. **Outdated limits**: Which dollar limits need updating for current market rates?
4. **Missing categories**: New expense types (home office, AI tools, wellness) not addressed?
5. **Simplification opportunities**: Rules that could be simplified without increasing risk
6. **Enforcement mechanisms**: How to make the policy self-enforcing through system controls
7. **Communication plan**: How to roll out policy changes so employees actually read them

Provide a revised policy draft with tracked changes and rationale for each update.
