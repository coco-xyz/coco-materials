## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Security Scanning Is Draining Your Team's Productivity**

In today's fast-paced SaaS & Technology landscape, Developer professionals face mounting pressure to deliver results faster with fewer resources. The traditional approach to security scanning is manual, error-prone, and unsustainably slow.

Industry data shows that teams spend an average of 15-25 hours per week on tasks that could be automated or significantly accelerated. For Developer teams specifically, this translates to delayed deliverables, missed opportunities, and rising operational costs.

The downstream impact is severe: decision-makers wait longer for critical insights, competitive advantages erode, and talented professionals burn out on repetitive work instead of focusing on strategic initiatives that drive real business value.

2. **Intelligent Processing**: COCO analyzes your inputs across multiple dimensions simultaneously, applying industry-specific knowledge and best practices for SaaS & Technology.
