# Use Case #096: AI Revenue Recognition

**Role**: Revenue Accountant / Controller / CFO | **Industry**: SaaS, Technology, Professional Services | **Task**: Automation

## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Manual revenue recognition takes 120+ hours per quarter; restatement risk keeps the CFO up at night**

Manual revenue recognition takes 120+ hours per quarter; restatement risk keeps the CFO up at night. This isn't just an inconvenience — it's a measurable drag on the business. Teams that face this challenge report spending an average of 15-30 hours per week on manual workarounds that could be automated.

The real cost goes beyond the immediate time waste. When revenue accountants are stuck in reactive mode, strategic work doesn't happen. Opportunities are missed. Competitors who have solved this problem move faster, ship sooner, and serve customers better.

Most teams have tried to address this with a combination of spreadsheets, manual processes, and good intentions. The problem is that these approaches don't scale. What works for 10 items breaks at 100. What works for 100 collapses at 1,000. And in today's environment, you're dealing with thousands.
