# Video Script: AI Follow-up Writer
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "I pulled our CRM data last quarter and found the stat that keeps every sales leader up at night: 44% of reps give up aft"

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows frustrated worker, right side shows mounting task list. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "Manual processes drain your team's time and energy. Hours lost every week on tasks that should take minutes."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - After every call/meeting, auto-generates a recap email with action items, next steps, and a personal touch from conversation details
  - For quiet deals, writes contextual re-engagement emails: new case study that's relevant, product update they'd care about, industry news that connects to their pain point
  - Manages multi-touch sequences that adapt based on prospect behavior (opened but didn't reply = different angle; clicked the case study link = go deeper on ROI)
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Follow-up Writer automates the workflow end-to-end. Set it up once, and watch it work."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "The deal isn't lost when the prospect says no. It's lost when you stop following up"

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
