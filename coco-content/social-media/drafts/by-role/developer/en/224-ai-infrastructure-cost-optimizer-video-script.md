# Video Script: AI Infrastructure Cost Optimizer
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "A typical Series B SaaS company with $2M/year in AWS spend has $600K-$800K of addressable waste — over-provisioned instances chosen for safety margin, dev environments running 24/7, reserved instances that no longer match workload patterns, and orphaned resources from features deprecated two years ago. Nobody realizes it because nobody has time to audit every resource."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows a database instance running at 8% CPU utilization 90% of the time, right side shows a cloud bill growing 35% quarter-over-quarter with no corresponding user growth. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "The average engineering team overspends on cloud resources by 30-40% — not through negligence, but through the natural accumulation of time-pressured decisions: provision a little extra for safety, optimize later. Later never comes. The waste compounds invisibly in the background."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Cross-cloud spend analysis attributing costs to services, teams, and environments — identifying untagged orphan resources and anomalous cost increases correlated to specific deployments
  - Rightsizing analysis identifying instances consistently below 30% CPU/memory utilization with specific downsize recommendations, risk assessment, and projected monthly savings
  - Idle and orphaned resource detection: stopped EC2 instances still accruing EBS costs, unused load balancers, dev environments schedulable for off-hours shutdown
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Infrastructure Cost Optimizer compresses a 2-week finance audit into a 2-hour session — typically identifying 25-40% of cloud spend as optimizable in the first run."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "Idle resource cleanup and rightsizing produce 10-20% immediate cost reduction within 2-4 weeks. Reserved instance optimization adds another 15-25% on eligible workloads. Teams with COCO-generated cost attribution see 40% lower unnecessary resource provisioning in new deployments — efficiency becomes the default, not the exception."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
