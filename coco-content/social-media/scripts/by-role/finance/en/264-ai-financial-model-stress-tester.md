**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: A board meeting where management presents confident projections — then cut to 18 months later: covenant breach, emergency refinancing, stunned executives.
[Voiceover]: "Every financial model has a breaking point. Most companies find it after it breaks."

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Three-scenario slide deck — optimistic, base, pessimistic — all looking rosy. A finance analyst manually adjusting one cell in a spreadsheet and calling it a stress test.
[Voiceover]: "Management-selected downside scenarios systematically understate real risk. Companies overestimate 5-year revenue by 41%. And the stress test? Usually one slide. Never enough."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: Finance analyst inputs a five-year model into COCO. COCO identifies top 8 sensitive assumptions, runs multi-variable stress scenarios, shows the exact churn rate at which the model goes cash-negative.
[Voiceover]: "COCO stress tests every key assumption — not just one at a time, but in correlated combinations. It finds your model's breakpoints: the specific revenue decline that trips your debt covenant, the churn rate that erodes your runway."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: Board presentation with honest risk narrative. CFO presenting with credibility. A covenant breach averted because the risk was found 6 months early.
[Voiceover]: "4.3 hidden risks surfaced per model. Covenant breach predicted 6 months early. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
