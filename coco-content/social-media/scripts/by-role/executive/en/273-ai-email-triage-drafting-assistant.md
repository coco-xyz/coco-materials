**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: Executive's inbox with 847 unread messages. Red notification badges everywhere. Calendar packed. Phone ringing.
[Voiceover]: "You spend 3 hours a day on email. And 70% of it doesn't need you personally."

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Executive reading, starting to reply, getting interrupted, switching tabs — the endless reactive loop. Clock fast-forwards.
[Voiceover]: "The average professional takes 23 minutes to refocus after each email interruption. For executives managing hundreds of messages a day, that's not an inbox problem — it's a focus crisis costing 90 minutes of deep work every single day."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: COCO triage view — emails sorted into URGENT / DELEGATE / MONITOR. COCO drafts a response to a board member email, with tone calibrated to the relationship. Executive reviews, adjusts two words, hits send.
[Voiceover]: "COCO triages your inbox — urgent, delegate, or monitor. For what needs your voice, it drafts the response, calibrated to your tone and relationship. You review, refine, send. What took 3 hours now takes 60 minutes."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
