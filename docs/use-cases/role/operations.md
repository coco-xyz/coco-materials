**The Pain: Meetings Produce Decisions and Action Items That Immediately Vanish**

Professionals spend 31 hours per month in unproductive meetings (Atlassian research). But the bigger problem isn't the time in meetings -- it's the value lost after meetings. Decisions made in meetings aren't documented reliably. Action items aren't tracked. Commitments aren't followed up on. Three days later, people remember the meeting differently, and the whole conversation happens again.

Manual meeting notes are inherently flawed. The note-taker can't fully participate while writing. They capture what they think is important, not what the group decides is important. And notes taken during the meeting are often unstructured and incomplete.

The organizational cost is staggering. When decisions aren't documented, they get relitigated. When action items aren't tracked, they don't happen. When meeting outcomes aren't shared, only attendees have the context, creating information silos. A Harvard Business Review study found that 73% of professionals do other work during meetings -- partly because they've learned that meeting outcomes rarely translate into action anyway.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Meeting Notes captures everything, structures it, and ensures follow-through.

1. **Real-Time Transcription**: Joins meetings via calendar integration and produces accurate transcripts:
   - Supports Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Webex
   - Speaker identification (who said what)
   - Multiple language support and real-time translation
   - Handles overlapping speakers and background noise
   - Records audio/video with consent management

2. **Structured Note Generation**: Within minutes of meeting end, produces:
   - **Executive summary** (2-3 sentences: what was the meeting about and what was the outcome)
   - **Decisions made** (with context, rationale, and who made the call)
   - **Action items** (with owner, deadline, priority, and dependencies)
   - **Key discussion points** (organized by topic, not chronologically)
   - **Open questions and parking lot items** (unresolved topics for future meetings)
   - **Sentiment and engagement indicators** (who participated most, topics that generated debate)

3. **Automated Distribution**: Posts notes to the right channels:
   - Slack channel based on meeting type and attendees
   - Notion/Confluence page in the appropriate project space
   - Email to attendees and relevant stakeholders who weren't in the meeting
   - Calendar event update with notes attached
   - Custom webhooks for project management tools (Jira, Asana, Linear)

4. **Action Item Tracking**: Goes beyond note-taking into accountability:
   - Creates tasks in your project management tool automatically
   - Assigns to the named owner with deadline
   - Sends reminder 24 hours before deadline
   - Follows up on overdue items (gentle nudge, then escalation)
   - Reports on completion rates by team and individual
   - Carries forward uncompleted items to next meeting agenda

5. **Meeting Analytics**: Provides insights on meeting patterns:
   - Meeting frequency, duration, and attendee overlap
   - Decision-to-action completion rates (are meetings producing results?)
   - Time spent in meetings vs. time spent on action items
   - Recurring meetings that rarely produce decisions (candidates for elimination)
   - Meeting cost calculator (attendee salaries x duration)

6. **Searchable Archive**: All meeting notes are indexed and searchable:
   - "What did we decide about pricing in Q1?" returns the exact meeting, decision, and context
   - "Who committed to the API redesign?" returns the owner, deadline, and current status
   - Cross-meeting pattern detection: "How many times have we discussed this topic without deciding?"
   - Compliance-friendly retention and access controls

::: details Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Structure Meeting Notes**
```
Convert these raw meeting notes/transcript into structured, actionable meeting documentation.

Meeting: [meeting name/purpose]
Date: [date]
Attendees: [list names and roles]
Duration: [X minutes]

Raw notes/transcript:
[paste unstructured notes or transcript]

Generate structured notes:
1. **Executive Summary** (2-3 sentences: what was the meeting about and what was the outcome)
2. **Decisions Made** (numbered list, each with context)
3. **Action Items** (table format: Item | Owner | Deadline | Priority)
4. **Key Discussion Points** (bullet summary of important topics discussed)
5. **Open Questions** (unresolved items for next meeting)
6. **Next Meeting** (date if scheduled, agenda items)

Format cleanly for posting in [Slack/Notion/email].
```

**Prompt 2: Generate Weekly Decisions Digest**
```
Compile a weekly decisions and commitments digest from these meeting notes.

Meeting notes from this week:
[paste or summarize notes from multiple meetings]

Generate a digest for leadership that includes:
1. **Key Decisions This Week** (decision, meeting where it was made, impact)
2. **Major Action Items** (item, owner, deadline, status)
3. **Risks and Blockers Raised** (issue, responsible team, mitigation)
4. **Upcoming Deadlines** (commitments coming due in the next 2 weeks)
5. **Items Needing Leadership Input** (decisions deferred, escalations)

Keep it scannable -- a busy executive should get the full picture in 2 minutes.
```

**Prompt 3: Meeting Effectiveness Analysis**
```
Analyze our meeting patterns and recommend improvements.

Meeting data (past month):
[describe or paste: meeting types, frequency, duration, attendee count, outcomes]

For example:
- Weekly team standup: 30 min, 12 attendees, Mon/Wed/Fri
- Sprint planning: 2 hours, 8 attendees, every 2 weeks
- 1:1s: 30 min each, [X] per week
- Cross-team syncs: 1 hour, 6 attendees, weekly
- All-hands: 1 hour, 40 attendees, monthly

Analyze:
1. **Time investment**: Total hours/week in meetings per person. Is it sustainable?
2. **Decision output**: Which meetings consistently produce decisions vs. which just "discuss"?
3. **Attendee efficiency**: Which meetings have too many attendees (who could be async instead)?
4. **Redundancy**: Are any meetings covering the same ground?
5. **Missing meetings**: Are there gaps (e.g., no cross-team alignment, no retrospectives)?
6. **Format optimization**: Which meetings should be shorter, less frequent, or async?
7. **Cost analysis**: Estimated salary cost of current meeting load

Provide a specific "meeting diet" recommendation: what to keep, cut, shorten, merge, or convert to async.

**The Pain: Inventory Forecasting with Spreadsheets Costs Millions in Stockouts and Overstock**

Inventory management is a balancing act where both sides of the failure are expensive. Stockouts mean lost revenue, disappointed customers, and market share gifted to competitors. Overstock means tied-up working capital, warehousing costs, markdowns, and write-offs. The optimal point between them requires accurate demand forecasting -- and that's where most companies fail.

Traditional forecasting relies on historical sales data adjusted with growth factors and planner intuition. This approach misses demand signals that don't appear in historical data: viral social media moments, competitor stockouts, weather-driven demand shifts, macroeconomic changes, and promotional calendar effects.

The cost of getting it wrong is staggering. IHL Group estimates that global retailers lose $1.75 trillion annually to overstock and out-of-stock situations combined. For a mid-size e-commerce company doing $50M in revenue, forecast errors typically represent $2-5M in lost sales and write-downs. The demand planner using Excel is doing their best with inadequate tools against an increasingly unpredictable market.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Inventory Forecaster combines historical analysis with real-time signal detection for SKU-level demand prediction.

1. **Multi-Variable Demand Modeling**: Goes far beyond "last year + growth factor":
   - Analyzes 24-36 months of sales history per SKU
   - Decomposes time series into trend, seasonality, and cyclical components
   - Accounts for promotions, pricing changes, and product lifecycle stage
   - Models cannibalization effects (new product launches stealing from existing SKUs)
   - Handles new product forecasting using analog products and market data

2. **External Signal Integration**: Incorporates data that spreadsheets can't:
   - Competitor intelligence: competitor pricing changes, stock availability, promotional activity
   - Social media trends: viral mentions, influencer posts, hashtag velocity
   - Weather data: temperature and precipitation forecasts affecting seasonal products
   - Economic indicators: consumer confidence, employment data, inflation trends
   - Industry reports: category growth data, market share shifts
   - Calendar effects: holidays, events, school schedules, cultural observances

3. **Probabilistic Forecasting**: Replaces single-number predictions with risk-aware ranges:
   - Provides demand forecasts with 80% confidence intervals (low / expected / high)
   - Enables risk-weighted inventory decisions (stock to the 80th percentile for critical SKUs, 50th for low-margin)
   - Quantifies forecast uncertainty per SKU (some products are inherently more predictable)
   - Monte Carlo simulation for peak period planning (Black Friday, holiday season)

4. **Reorder Optimization**: Calculates optimal inventory parameters:
   - **Reorder point**: When to place a new order (considering lead time and demand variability)
   - **Reorder quantity**: How much to order (balancing ordering cost vs. carrying cost)
   - **Safety stock**: Buffer inventory needed to achieve target service level
   - **Dynamic adjustment**: Parameters update automatically as demand patterns change
   - **Supplier lead time modeling**: Accounts for variability in supplier delivery times

5. **Anomaly Detection and Early Warning**: Catches demand shifts before they become problems:
   - Real-time sales velocity monitoring against forecast
   - Automatic alerts when actuals deviate significantly from predictions
   - Root cause hypotheses: "SKU #4721 trending 340% above forecast -- possible causes: TikTok mention Jan 12 (145K views), competitor stockout detected Jan 10"
   - Enables rapid response: emergency reorder, substitution planning, demand channeling

6. **What-If Scenarios**: Models the impact of business decisions on inventory needs:
   - "What if we run a 20% off promotion on this category?"
   - "What if Supplier A's lead time increases from 4 weeks to 8 weeks?"
   - "What if we launch Product B -- how does it cannibalize Product A?"
   - "What if we expand to 3 new geographic markets?"
   - Helps leadership make inventory-aware business decisions

**Prompt 2: Inventory Health Audit**
```
Audit our current inventory for optimization opportunities.

Current inventory:
[paste inventory data: SKU, quantity on hand, unit cost, average monthly sales, days of supply]

Analyze and identify:
1. **Overstock** (>90 days supply): Which SKUs have excess? Estimated carrying cost?
2. **Stockout risk** (<14 days supply for high-velocity items): Which SKUs need urgent reorder?
3. **Dead stock** (<1 unit sold in 90 days): Value tied up in non-moving inventory?
4. **ABC classification**: Categorize SKUs by revenue contribution (A=top 80%, B=next 15%, C=bottom 5%)
5. **Reorder priorities**: Ranked list of SKUs to reorder this week
6. **Liquidation candidates**: SKUs to consider discounting or writing off
7. **Working capital opportunity**: How much capital can be freed by optimizing?
```

**Prompt 3: Supply Chain Disruption Scenario Planning**
```
Help me plan for potential supply chain disruptions and their inventory impact.

Current supply chain:
- Key suppliers: [list suppliers, products, lead times, geographic locations]
- Current inventory levels: [by product category or key SKUs]
- Monthly demand: [average monthly sales by category]
- Alternative suppliers: [list any backup suppliers and their capabilities]

Model these scenarios:
1. **Supplier delay**: Primary supplier lead time increases from [X] to [Y] weeks. Impact on stockouts? Recommended safety stock adjustment?
2. **Demand spike**: [Category/SKU] demand increases [X]% due to [reason]. Can current inventory and supply pipeline handle it?
3. **Logistics disruption**: Shipping from [region] delayed by [X] weeks. Which SKUs are most at risk? Alternative sourcing options?
4. **Raw material shortage**: Key component becomes scarce, reducing supplier capacity by [X]%. Allocation strategy?

For each scenario:
- Financial impact (lost sales, expediting costs, carrying costs)
- Recommended preventive actions now
- Trigger points for executing contingency plans
- Communication plan for sales/marketing teams

::: details Pain Point & How COCO Solves It

**The Pain: Vendor Evaluation Is Slow, Subjective, and Risky**

Vendor selection is one of the highest-stakes procurement decisions -- and one of the most poorly executed. A bad vendor selection doesn't just waste budget; it creates operational disruption, implementation failures, contract disputes, and sometimes years of lock-in to an inadequate solution.

The root causes are systemic. Evaluation processes are manual and inconsistent. Different stakeholders evaluate vendors using different criteria, different weights, and different levels of rigor. The vendor with the best presentation often wins over the vendor with the best product. Reference checks are theater -- vendors provide their happiest customers, not a representative sample.

Most critically, available intelligence about vendors goes unanalyzed. G2 and Capterra have thousands of verified reviews. Glassdoor reveals implementation and support quality. SEC filings show financial stability. Job postings reveal strategic direction. Court records show litigation patterns. All of this data exists but nobody has time to synthesize it during a procurement cycle.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Vendor Evaluator standardizes, accelerates, and deepens the vendor evaluation process.

1. **RFP Generation**: Creates comprehensive, requirement-aligned RFPs that ensure:
   - All functional requirements captured from stakeholder input
   - Non-functional requirements included (security, compliance, scalability)
   - Evaluation criteria and scoring methodology defined upfront
   - Standard format that makes vendor responses comparable

2. **Proposal Analysis**: When vendor proposals come in, COCO:
   - Extracts and normalizes responses against each requirement
   - Identifies requirements that are fully met, partially met, or not addressed
   - Compares pricing structures (accounting for different pricing models)
   - Flags vague or non-committal responses
   - Generates a side-by-side comparison matrix

3. **Independent Vendor Intelligence**: Beyond what vendors tell you, COCO researches:
   - **Customer Reviews**: G2, Capterra, TrustRadius -- sentiment analysis and common complaints
   - **Employee Reviews**: Glassdoor themes about product quality, support, and company stability
   - **Financial Health**: Revenue trends, funding, profitability indicators
   - **Market Position**: Analyst reports, market share, competitive trajectory
   - **Risk Indicators**: Litigation, data breaches, key executive departures, customer churn signals

4. **Contract Analysis**: COCO reviews vendor contracts and flags:
   - Non-standard terms that deviate from your preferred contract template
   - Missing SLAs or SLAs below your requirements
   - Auto-renewal clauses and termination restrictions
   - Hidden cost escalators (annual price increases, overage charges)
   - Data ownership, portability, and deletion obligations
   - Liability caps and indemnification gaps

5. **Scoring and Recommendation**: COCO produces a defensible evaluation:
   - Weighted scoring across all criteria (functional, technical, financial, risk)
   - Sensitivity analysis (how does the ranking change if weights change?)
   - Clear recommendation with justification
   - Dissenting factors (areas where the recommended vendor is weak)

6. **Vendor Risk Scoring**: Each vendor gets a risk score (0-100) based on:
   - Financial stability and runway
   - Customer concentration (are they dependent on a few large customers?)
   - Implementation success rate (from reviews and references)
   - Support quality indicators
   - Key person dependency
   - Technology platform maturity

- Termination: [our preferred termination terms]
- Liability: [our minimum liability/indemnification expectations]
- Pricing: [our expectations on price escalation caps]

Analyze:
1. **Non-standard terms**: Clauses that deviate from typical market terms
2. **Missing protections**: SLAs, data rights, or obligations that should be included but aren't
3. **Hidden costs**: Auto-renewal traps, overage charges, price escalation clauses
4. **Termination risks**: Lock-in provisions, exit penalties, data extraction limitations
5. **Liability gaps**: Where liability caps or indemnification may be insufficient
6. **Negotiation priorities**: Top 5 terms to push back on, with suggested alternative language

Present as a redline summary that I can share with legal.
```

**Prompt 4: Vendor Risk Assessment**
```
Perform a risk assessment for [Vendor Name] as a potential critical supplier.

Information available:
- Company background: [what you know - size, age, funding, ownership]
- Product: [what they sell, who their customers are]
- Reviews: [G2/Capterra ratings if known]
- Financial: [any financial information available]
- Contract value to us: $[X]/year

Assess risk across dimensions:
1. **Financial risk**: Can they sustain operations? Signs of financial distress?
2. **Operational risk**: Implementation success rate, support quality, uptime history
3. **Strategic risk**: Are they being acquired? Pivoting away from our use case? Losing market share?
4. **Concentration risk**: How dependent are they on a few customers? How dependent would we be on them?
5. **Security/compliance risk**: Data handling, certifications, breach history
6. **Key person risk**: Is the company dependent on specific individuals?

Overall risk score (0-100) with justification and recommended mitigation for each high-risk area.
