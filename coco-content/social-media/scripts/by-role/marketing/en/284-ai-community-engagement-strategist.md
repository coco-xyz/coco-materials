# #284 - AI Community Engagement Strategist — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Marketing / Community-Led Growth
**Metric**: 45% member retention → 75% retention; 4-5 hrs/day content work → 90 minutes

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: Community Slack workspace with 847 members and a single post from 11 days ago. Tumbleweeds.
[Voiceover]: "You launched a community. Then 60 days later — it became a ghost town."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Community manager copying-and-pasting company announcements into Slack. Members not reacting. Analytics showing 3% weekly active rate.
[Voiceover]: "The average company community drops to 3% weekly active members within 90 days of launch. Community managers spend 5 hours daily on content — and still can't spark real conversation. Because posting announcements isn't community building. It's broadcasting."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: COCO generating daily discussion prompts, member spotlight templates, and AMA frameworks. Community manager spending time responding to actual conversations.
[Voiceover]: "COCO handles the systematic content — daily discussion starters, onboarding sequences, power-member outreach, feedback synthesis — so your community manager can do what actually matters: build relationships. 90 minutes of content work instead of 5 hours."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: Active community feed full of member posts, reactions, and threads. Retention dashboard showing 75% 90-day retention.
[Voiceover]: "75% member retention. 5x more user-generated posts. A community that actually builds pipeline. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
