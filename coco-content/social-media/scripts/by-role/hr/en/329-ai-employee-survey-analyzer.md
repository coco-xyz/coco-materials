**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: HR analyst staring at 800 rows of open-text survey responses, head in hands
[Voiceover]: "You asked your employees what's wrong. They told you. And now their answers are sitting unread in a spreadsheet."

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Dashboard with pretty engagement charts, leadership asking "so what do we do?", analyst saying "we're still processing the open-text responses"
[Voiceover]: "Engagement surveys collect rich qualitative data that most teams never fully analyze. Weeks pass. Leadership wants answers. And the employees who shared their feedback are watching — and deciding whether to stay."

[Visual]: HR dropping survey data into COCO, themes emerging with percentages and quotes, executive summary generating, action recommendations appearing

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
