## Part 1: Social Media Copy

### English

We analyzed why our engineering roles took 47 days to fill while the industry median was 36. The bottleneck wasn't sourcing or interviews -- it was applications. Our pipeline was thin because qualified candidates weren't applying. When we audited our job descriptions, the reason became obvious. They read like compliance documents, not job advertisements.

"Must have 7+ years in enterprise Java development with Spring Boot, Hibernate, and microservices architecture in a CI/CD environment utilizing Docker and Kubernetes in AWS." That was our opening line. Not what the role was about. Not why someone would want this job. Just a wall of requirements that made 70% of qualified women and underrepresented candidates self-select out (Stanford research shows women apply only when meeting 100% of requirements; men apply at 60%).

COCO's AI Job Description Writer rewired our approach:
- Analyzes the actual role needs and separates true requirements from nice-to-haves
- Writes descriptions that lead with impact and growth, not requirement lists
- Runs inclusive language analysis: removes gendered language, excessive requirements, and exclusionary jargon
- Benchmarks compensation against market data so we don't underprice roles
- Generates versions optimized for different channels (LinkedIn, Indeed, careers page)

Application volume: +64%. Female applicants: +41%. Diverse candidates in pipeline: +38%. Time-to-fill: from 47 to 31 days. Same roles, better descriptions.

我们分析了为什么我们的工程职位需要47天才能填补，而行业中位数是36天。瓶颈不是寻源或面试——是申请量。Pipeline很薄因为合格候选人不申请。当我们审计职位描述时，原因变得明显了。它们读起来像合规文件，不像招聘广告。

"必须有7年以上企业级Java开发经验，使用Spring Boot、Hibernate和微服务架构，在使用Docker和Kubernetes的CI/CD环境中于AWS上。"这是我们的开头。不是关于这个角色做什么。不是为什么有人会想要这份工作。只是一堵需求墙，让70%合格的女性和少数群体候选人自动放弃了（斯坦福研究显示女性只有在满足100%要求时才申请；男性在60%时就会申请）。

COCO的AI Job Description Writer重构了我们的方法：
- 分析实际角色需求，将真正的要求和加分项分开
- 撰写以影响力和成长开头的描述，而非需求清单
- 运行包容性语言分析：移除性别化语言、过多要求和排斥性行话
- 对照市场数据基准化薪酬以免定价过低
- 生成针对不同渠道优化的版本（LinkedIn、Indeed、招聘页面）

申请量：+64%。女性申请者：+41%。Pipeline中的多元化候选人：+38%。招聘周期：从47天降至31天。同样的职位，更好的描述。

## Part 2: Detailed Introduction

### English

**The Pain: Bad Job Descriptions Are Invisible Pipeline Killers**

Job descriptions are the most read and least optimized piece of content in most companies. They're written once, copied from templates or previous postings, edited minimally, and posted. Yet they are the single most important factor in determining who applies for your roles.

Research consistently shows that poorly written JDs have measurable negative effects: excessive requirements reduce the applicant pool (particularly among women and underrepresented groups), jargon-heavy language discourages career changers, and "requirements" that are actually preferences cause the best candidates to self-select out.

Most hiring managers write JDs that describe their ideal candidate -- someone who has already done this exact job. This eliminates candidates with high potential who could grow into the role, career changers who bring fresh perspectives, and candidates from adjacent fields with transferable skills.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Job Description Writer creates compelling, inclusive, and effective job descriptions that attract the right candidates.

1. **Role Analysis**: COCO works with the hiring manager to clarify the actual role:
   - What will this person do in their first 90 days?
   - What skills are genuinely required vs. learnable on the job?
   - What does success look like at 6 and 12 months?
   - What makes this role unique and exciting?

2. **Impact-First Structure**: COCO writes JDs that lead with what matters to candidates:
   - **Hook**: Why this role matters and what impact the person will have
   - **What You'll Do**: Specific responsibilities framed as outcomes, not tasks
   - **What You Bring**: Separated into "Required" (genuinely non-negotiable) and "Nice to Have"
   - **What We Offer**: Compensation range, benefits, growth opportunities, culture
   - **About Us**: Company mission and team context

3. **Inclusive Language Optimization**: COCO scans for and corrects:
   - Gendered language ("rockstar," "ninja," "he/she" defaults)
   - Unnecessary requirements that exclude diverse candidates
   - Jargon that discourages career changers
   - Age-coded language ("digital native," "young and energetic")
   - Ability-biased language that excludes disabled candidates

4. **Compensation Intelligence**: COCO helps position compensation competitively:
   - Market rate benchmarking based on role, location, and company stage
   - Pay transparency compliance (where legally required)
   - Benefits and perks framing that resonates with target candidates
   - Total compensation positioning

5. **Channel Optimization**: Different platforms need different versions:
   - **LinkedIn**: Professional tone, network-shareable, emphasis on company brand
   - **Indeed**: Keyword-optimized for search, clear compensation
   - **Careers Page**: Detailed, culture-rich, with team information
   - **Internal Posting**: Growth opportunity framing, internal mobility emphasis

6. **Performance Tracking**: COCO helps measure JD effectiveness:
   - Application rate per channel
   - Quality of applicant pool (% meeting requirements)
   - Demographic diversity of applicants
   - Time-to-fill compared to previous versions

**Measurable Results**

- **Application volume**: +64% increase
- **Female applicants**: +41% increase
- **Diverse candidates in pipeline**: +38% increase
- **Time-to-fill**: From 47 to 31 days (34% reduction)
- **JD writing time**: From 2 hours to 20 minutes
- **Application-to-interview ratio**: Improved from 8% to 14% (better qualified applicants)

**Who Benefits**

- **Recruiters**: Higher application volumes with better-qualified candidates
- **Hiring Managers**: Clearer role definition leads to better hiring outcomes
- **Candidates**: Understand the role, impact, and requirements clearly
- **D&I Leaders**: More inclusive language attracts more diverse candidate pools

**痛点：糟糕的职位描述是看不见的Pipeline杀手**

职位描述是大多数公司中阅读量最大但优化最少的内容。写一次，从模板或以前的发布中复制，最少的编辑然后发布。然而它是决定谁会申请你职位的最重要的单一因素。

研究持续表明，写得差的JD有可衡量的负面效果：过多的要求减少申请池（特别是女性和少数群体），充满术语的语言劝退转行者，实际上是"偏好"的"要求"导致最佳候选人自我淘汰。

4. **Missing Elements**: What's missing that candidates care about? (compensation, growth, impact)
5. **Keyword Optimization**: Is it discoverable on job boards?

Each version should feel native to the platform while maintaining consistent core messaging.
