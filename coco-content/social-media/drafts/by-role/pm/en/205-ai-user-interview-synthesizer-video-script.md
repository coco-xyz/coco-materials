# Video Script: AI User Interview Synthesizer
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "30 user interviews. 50 hours of recordings. And 3 weeks later, your 'insight report' reflects what the PM remembered from the last two sessions — not what 30 users actually said."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows stacks of unreviewed transcripts, right side shows product decisions made from 3 memorable quotes. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "Manual synthesis reviews barely 40% of transcripts. Teams build features confidently based on the loudest voices — while contradictory signals from 12 other participants go unread."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Cross-interview pattern recognition across 100% of transcripts simultaneously
  - Pain point taxonomy with frequency, severity, and supporting verbatim quotes
  - Insight-to-opportunity mapping formatted for roadmap intake
Voiceover: "COCO's AI User Interview Synthesizer compresses 3 weeks of manual analysis into 4 hours — with full coverage of every participant's signal. Deploy in minutes."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "Research-to-roadmap lag cut from 6 weeks to under 2. Teams surface 3–4x more distinct pain points per cycle. PM confidence in prioritization decisions up 60%."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
