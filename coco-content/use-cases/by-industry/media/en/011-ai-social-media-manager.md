## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Social Media Demands Infinite Content Across Incompatible Platforms**

Social media marketing is a treadmill that accelerates faster than you can run. Algorithms reward posting frequency and consistency. Audience expectations differ wildly across platforms. What works on LinkedIn -- long-form professional narratives -- bombs on Twitter. What goes viral on TikTok is invisible on Facebook. Each platform is essentially a different content job.

For small and mid-size marketing teams, this creates an impossible workload. A single social media manager is expected to be a copywriter, graphic designer, community manager, data analyst, and trend spotter -- simultaneously, across 4-6 platforms. The result is either burnout (trying to do everything) or underperformance (doing a mediocre job everywhere).

Even larger teams with dedicated platform owners face the coordination problem: ensuring consistent brand messaging across platforms while adapting to each platform's unique requirements.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Social Media Manager acts as a force multiplier for social media teams, handling the labor-intensive production work so humans can focus on strategy and authentic engagement.

1. **One-to-Many Content Transformation**: Give COCO a single content source (blog post, press release, product update, industry insight) and it generates optimized versions for each platform:
   - **LinkedIn**: Professional narrative with personal insight angle, 1,200-1,500 characters, hook in first two lines, strategic line breaks, relevant hashtags (3-5)
   - **Twitter/X**: Punchy, opinionated take under 280 characters, optional thread format for longer topics, relevant hashtags (1-2)
   - **Instagram**: Engaging caption with storytelling arc, emoji formatting, 20-30 targeted hashtags, CTA in caption
   - **Facebook**: Conversational tone, question-driven to encourage comments, link-friendly format
   - **TikTok**: Script-style content with hook-retain-payoff structure, trending audio suggestions

2. **Brand Voice Consistency**: COCO learns your brand's voice from existing content:
   - Tone (professional, casual, witty, authoritative)

## Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Multi-Platform Content Generation from Blog Post**
```
Transform this blog post into social media content for 5 platforms. Each version should feel native to the platform, not like a copy-paste.

Blog post:
[paste blog post]

Generate:

1. **LinkedIn post** (1,200-1,500 characters): Professional narrative angle, personal insight hook in first 2 lines, 3-5 hashtags
2. **Twitter/X post** (under 280 characters): Punchy one-liner or bold take that makes people stop scrolling. If the topic warrants it, also create a 4-tweet thread version
3. **Instagram caption** (150-200 words): Storytelling format, emoji-enhanced, 25 relevant hashtags in a separate paragraph, end with a question CTA
4. **Facebook post** (100-150 words): Conversational, question-driven, designed to generate comments
5. **TikTok script** (30-60 second video): Hook in first 3 seconds, main content, CTA. Include suggested visual/action descriptions

Brand voice: [professional/casual/witty - describe your brand voice]
Target audience: [describe your audience]
```

**Prompt 2: Weekly Content Calendar**
```
Create a 5-day social media content calendar for [brand/company name].

Context:
- Industry: [your industry]
- Platforms: [list platforms]
- Posting frequency: [X posts per platform per week]
- Current marketing campaigns: [list any active campaigns]
- Upcoming events/launches: [list any]
- Content pillars: [e.g., thought leadership, product updates, customer stories, industry news, team culture]

For each post include:
- Platform
- Day and suggested time
- Post copy (platform-optimized)
- Content type (text, image, video, carousel, poll)
- Visual direction (brief description of image/graphic needed)
- Hashtags
- CTA

Balance: 40% value/educational, 30% engagement/community, 20% promotional, 10% trend/timely
```

**Prompt 3: Comment Response Drafts**
```
Draft responses to these social media comments in our brand voice.

Brand voice guidelines: [describe - e.g., "friendly, professional, uses humor occasionally, never defensive"]
Company: [name and what you do]

Comments to respond to:

1. [Platform]: "[paste comment]" - Sentiment: [positive/question/complaint/neutral]
2. [Platform]: "[paste comment]" - Sentiment: [positive/question/complaint/neutral]
3. [Platform]: "[paste comment]" - Sentiment: [positive/question/complaint/neutral]
[...continue]

For complaints: Acknowledge the issue, show empathy, offer next steps (DM for details, link to support). Never be defensive.
For questions: Answer directly if possible, or direct to the right resource.
For positive comments: Show genuine appreciation, don't be generic.
```

**Prompt 4: Social Media Performance Analysis**
```
Analyze this week's social media performance and provide actionable recommendations.

This week's posts and metrics:

Post 1: [Platform] - [post summary] - Likes: [X], Comments: [X], Shares: [X], Impressions: [X]
Post 2: [Platform] - [post summary] - Likes: [X], Comments: [X], Shares: [X], Impressions: [X]
[...continue for all posts]

Previous week comparison: [total engagement last week vs this week]

Analyze:
1. Which content themes/formats performed best and worst? Why?
2. Are there patterns in timing that correlate with engagement?
3. Which platform is growing fastest? Which needs attention?
4. What should we do more of next week?
5. What should we stop doing?
6. 3 specific content ideas for next week based on what worked
```

**Prompt 5: Trend-Jacking Content**
```
The following topic/trend is currently trending on social media: "[describe the trend, meme, or news event]"

Our brand: [describe your brand, industry, and values]
Our audience: [describe target audience]

Generate brand-appropriate ways to participate in this trend for:
1. Twitter/X: Quick, witty take (under 280 characters)
2. LinkedIn: Professional angle connecting the trend to an industry insight
3. Instagram: Visual concept description + caption
4. TikTok: 15-30 second video concept with script

For each, rate:
- Relevance to our brand (1-10)
- Risk level (low/medium/high - could this backfire?)
- Timeliness (how quickly do we need to post before it's stale?)

Only suggest participation if relevance is 6+ and risk is low-medium.
```
