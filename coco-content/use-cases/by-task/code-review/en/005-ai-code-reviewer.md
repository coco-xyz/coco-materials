# #5 - AI Code Reviewer

**Category**: Dev Team / Engineering
**Pain**: PR reviews bottleneck the entire dev cycle — senior devs spend half their day reading other people's code
**Solution**: COCO AI agent reviews every PR automatically — catches bugs, style issues, security flaws, and suggests improvements before a human ever looks at it
**Metric**: 4 hours per PR review cycle → 15 minutes

## Social Media Copy (English)

Your senior devs spend 4 hours per PR cycle just reviewing code. That's not engineering — that's babysitting.

We hired an AI code reviewer. It catches bugs, flags security issues, and suggests fixes in 15 minutes.

Senior devs now review AI's summary, not raw diffs.
