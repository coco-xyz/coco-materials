## Social Media Copy

I ran a content team of 3 writers. We published 2 articles per week. Each one took the same grind: 2 hours on keyword research. 1 hour analyzing top-ranking competitors. 1 hour on the outline. 3-4 hours writing. 30 minutes on meta tags, internal links, and formatting. One article: 7-8 hours of skilled labor. Cost per piece: ~$400 when you factor in salaries.

At that rate, we could cover maybe 100 keywords per year. Our competitor's domain had 4,200 ranked keywords. We were literally years behind with no way to catch up.

COCO's AI SEO Content Writer didn't replace my writers -- it made each of them 5x more productive:
- Input a target keyword, COCO analyzes the top 10 SERP results
- Identifies content gaps competitors missed
- Generates a complete 2,000-word article with proper H2/H3 structure, semantic keywords naturally woven in, meta title, meta description
- Suggests internal links from our existing content
- Writer reviews, adds brand voice and expert insights, publishes

Time per article: 90 minutes (down from 7-8 hours). Output: 12 articles/week (up from 2). Organic traffic after 5 months: +187%. Cost per article dropped from $400 to under $90.

The math on SEO content doesn't work with humans alone anymore. Pair your writers with AI and actually compete.

## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: The SEO Content Arms Race Is Unwinnable at Human Speed**

SEO content marketing is a volume game with a quality floor. To rank for competitive keywords, you need comprehensive, authoritative, well-structured content -- and you need a lot of it. Google's algorithm rewards topical authority, which means covering a subject cluster deeply with dozens of interlinked articles.

The economics are brutal. A quality SEO article requires multiple specialized skills: keyword research, competitive analysis, subject matter expertise, copywriting, on-page SEO optimization, and internal linking strategy. Each article takes 6-10 hours of skilled work. At $50-100/hour for experienced content marketers, the cost per piece ranges from $300-1,000.

Most companies can afford to publish 2-4 articles per week. Their competitors in established markets have thousands of indexed pages. The gap doesn't close -- it widens, because more existing content creates a compounding authority advantage.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI SEO Content Writer transforms the content creation pipeline from a serial, labor-intensive process into a scalable system.

1. **SERP Analysis Engine**: Given a target keyword, COCO:
   - Analyzes the top 10-20 ranking pages for that keyword
   - Extracts their content structure (headings, word count, topics covered)
   - Identifies semantic keywords and related terms (LSI keywords)
   - Spots content gaps -- topics the top results don't cover thoroughly
   - Assesses search intent (informational, transactional, navigational)

2. **Intelligent Outline Generation**: Based on SERP analysis, COCO generates an optimized outline that:
   - Covers everything the top results cover (table stakes)
   - Fills gaps competitors missed (competitive advantage)
   - Structures H2/H3 headings for maximum SEO value and readability
   - Suggests word count targets per section based on topic depth required
   - Includes "People Also Ask" questions as natural subheadings

3. **Full Article Generation**: COCO writes the complete article with:
   - Natural keyword density (primary keyword, secondary keywords, semantic terms)
   - Proper heading hierarchy and content structure
   - Engaging introduction with hook and clear value proposition
   - Substantive body sections with data, examples, and actionable advice
   - Strong conclusion with CTA
   - Scannable formatting (bullet points, numbered lists, bold key phrases)

4. **On-Page SEO Optimization**: Every article comes with:
   - Meta title (60 characters, keyword-optimized, click-worthy)
   - Meta description (155 characters, includes keyword, drives clicks)
   - URL slug suggestion
   - Image alt text recommendations
   - Schema markup suggestions (FAQ, HowTo, Article)
   - Internal link recommendations from your existing content library

5. **Content Differentiation**: COCO doesn't produce generic content. It:
   - Incorporates unique data points and statistics
   - Suggests original angles competitors haven't covered
   - Adapts tone and depth to your brand voice guidelines
   - Identifies opportunities for original research, surveys, or expert quotes that would strengthen E-E-A-T signals

6. **Content Calendar Integration**: At scale, COCO helps plan:
   - Topic cluster mapping (pillar pages + supporting articles)
   - Keyword priority based on search volume, difficulty, and business value
   - Content refresh schedules for aging articles
   - Competitive content gap analysis at the domain level

**Measurable Results**

- **Content production**: From 2 articles/week to 12+ articles/week (6x increase)
- **Cost per article**: From $400 to under $90 (78% reduction)
- **Organic traffic**: +187% after 5 months
- **Keyword rankings**: 340+ keywords in top 10 (from 52)
- **Time per article**: From 7-8 hours to 90 minutes (81% reduction)

## Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Complete SEO Article from Keyword**
```
Write a comprehensive SEO article targeting the keyword "[your target keyword]".

Before writing, analyze:
1. Search intent for this keyword (informational/transactional/navigational)
2. What the top-ranking articles likely cover
3. Content gaps that would differentiate this article

Article requirements:
- Word count: 2,000-2,500 words
- Include H2 and H3 subheadings optimized for related keywords
- Natural keyword placement (primary keyword in title, H2, first 100 words, and conclusion)
- Include at least 3 data points or statistics with citations
- Add a FAQ section addressing 3-4 "People Also Ask" style questions
- Conversational yet authoritative tone
- Include actionable takeaways the reader can implement immediately

Also provide:
- Meta title (under 60 characters)
- Meta description (under 155 characters)
- 5 internal link anchor text suggestions
- 3 suggested images with alt text
```

**Prompt 2: Competitive Content Gap Analysis**
```
I'm competing against these domains for the topic "[your topic area]":
- [competitor1.com]
- [competitor2.com]
- [competitor3.com]

Analyze the likely content strategies of these competitors and identify:
1. Topics they all cover (table stakes I must match)
2. Topics only 1-2 of them cover (opportunities to differentiate)
3. Topics NONE of them cover well (content gaps = biggest opportunity)
4. Long-tail keyword opportunities they're likely missing
5. Content format gaps (e.g., they have guides but no comparison posts)

For each gap identified, provide:
- Suggested article title
- Target keyword and estimated search intent
- Brief outline (3-4 H2 headings)
- Priority (High/Medium/Low based on search volume potential and difficulty)

Output as a prioritized content calendar for the next 8 weeks.
```

**Prompt 3: Content Refresh for Declining Article**
```
This article was published [X months ago] and its rankings are declining. Refresh it for better performance.

Current article:
[paste article content]

Current performance:
- Target keyword: [keyword]
- Current ranking position: [X]
- Peak ranking position: [X] (achieved [date])
- Monthly organic traffic: [X] (down from [X])

Refresh the article by:
1. Updating all statistics and data points to current year
2. Adding new sections covering topics that have emerged since publication
3. Improving the introduction with a stronger hook
4. Strengthening E-E-A-T signals (experience, expertise, authority, trust)
5. Adding new FAQ questions based on current "People Also Ask" results
6. Optimizing for any new related keywords that have gained volume
7. Improving internal linking with newer published content

Provide the refreshed article and a changelog summarizing all changes made.
```

**Prompt 4: Topic Cluster Planning**
```
Build a comprehensive topic cluster strategy for "[your core topic]".

Create:
1. **Pillar page**: A comprehensive 3,000+ word guide covering the entire topic
   - Outline with H2/H3 structure
   - Target primary keyword and secondary keywords

2. **Supporting articles** (10-15 articles): Each targeting a specific long-tail keyword
   - Article title
   - Target keyword
   - Word count recommendation
   - How it links back to the pillar page
   - Brief outline (3 H2 headings)

3. **Internal linking map**: How all pieces connect to each other

4. **Publishing sequence**: Optimal order to publish for maximum SEO impact

My site's domain authority is approximately [X]. Focus on keywords with difficulty scores appropriate for this authority level.
```

**Prompt 5: Bulk Meta Tag Optimization**
```
Optimize the meta titles and descriptions for these existing pages. Each meta title must be under 60 characters and each meta description under 155 characters. Both should include the target keyword naturally and be compelling enough to improve click-through rate.

Pages to optimize:
1. URL: [url] | Current title: [title] | Target keyword: [keyword]
2. URL: [url] | Current title: [title] | Target keyword: [keyword]
3. URL: [url] | Current title: [title] | Target keyword: [keyword]
[...continue for all pages]

For each page provide:
- Optimized meta title (with character count)
- Optimized meta description (with character count)
- Rationale for changes
- Estimated CTR improvement potential (Low/Medium/High)
```
