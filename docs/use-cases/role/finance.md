::: details Pain Point & How COCO Solves It

**The Pain: Manual Expense Auditing Is Slow, Incomplete, and Expensive**

Expense report auditing is one of those necessary finance functions that everyone knows is broken but nobody fixes. The process is labor-intensive, error-prone, and still misses significant policy violations and fraud. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners estimates that organizations lose 5% of revenue to fraud, with expense reimbursement fraud being one of the most common types.

Manual auditing has a fundamental sampling problem. When reviewing 1,200 reports takes 160 hours, finance teams resort to sampling -- auditing 20-30% of reports in detail and rubber-stamping the rest. This means 70-80% of expense reports receive minimal scrutiny, creating a known vulnerability that sophisticated bad actors exploit.

The errors aren't just fraud. Honest mistakes are rampant: employees who don't know the policy, receipts that don't match claimed amounts due to currency conversion, duplicate submissions from confusing expense systems, and miscategorized expenses that distort departmental budgets. These errors, individually small, compound into material financial inaccuracies.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Expense Auditor provides 100% audit coverage with consistent policy enforcement.

1. **Receipt Processing**: OCR reads receipt images in any format -- paper scans, phone photos, PDF downloads, even screenshots. Extracts vendor name, date, amount, tax, and category. Cross-references against the claimed values. Flags mismatches with the exact discrepancy amount.

2. **Policy Compliance Engine**: Checks every line item against your full expense policy:
   - Meal limits (per person, per event, by meal type)
   - Hotel rate caps (by city tier, season, advance booking)
   - Flight booking windows (advance purchase requirements, class restrictions)
   - Entertainment policies (client presence required, per-event limits, description requirements)
   - Mileage rates (IRS standard vs. company rate, route verification)
   - Per diem rules (domestic vs. international, city-specific rates)
   - Approval thresholds (who needs to approve at each dollar level)

3. **Pattern Detection**: Identifies suspicious patterns across time and across submitters:
   - **Split transactions**: Breaking a $300 dinner into two $150 receipts to stay below the $200 approval limit
   - **Round numbers**: Too many expenses at exactly $50, $100, $75 -- likely estimates rather than actuals
   - **Weekend/holiday anomalies**: Expenses on non-work days without corresponding travel authorization
   - **Vendor frequency**: Same restaurant 15 times in a month raises questions
   - **Threshold gaming**: 8 out of 10 expenses at $49 when the receipt requirement starts at $50
   - **Cross-employee patterns**: Two employees claiming the same dinner on different reports

4. **Risk Scoring**: Each expense report gets a risk score (0-100):
   - **0-20**: Clean, auto-approve
   - **21-50**: Minor issues, auto-approve with notation
   - **51-75**: Review recommended (specific items flagged with policy citations)
   - **76-100**: High risk, mandatory human review with full analysis attached

5. **Smart Routing**: Based on risk score and issue type:
   - Clean reports: Auto-approved, no human touch needed
   - Medium-risk: Flagged items sent to submitter for clarification before approval
   - High-risk: Escalated to finance manager with full analysis, policy citations, and historical context

6. **Reporting and Analytics**: Monthly and quarterly dashboards:
   - Policy compliance rates by department, team, and individual
   - Top violation types and trends over time
   - Estimated cost savings from fraud prevention and error correction
   - Department-level spending patterns and budget impact
   - Recommendations for policy updates based on common edge cases

::: details Pain Point & How COCO Solves It

**The Pain: FP&A Teams Are Report Factories, Not Strategic Advisors**

FP&A teams exist to provide strategic financial insight. In practice, they spend most of their time assembling reports. McKinsey research shows that finance teams spend 60-70% of their time on data gathering and report preparation, leaving only 30-40% for actual analysis and strategic support. The irony: CFOs consistently rank "strategic business partnering" as FP&A's most important function -- and the one where they most underdeliver.

The monthly close and reporting cycle is the biggest time drain. FP&A analysts pull data from multiple systems (ERP, CRM, HRIS, billing), reconcile discrepancies, calculate variances, build charts, format reports, and write commentary -- the same process, with the same templates, every single month. It's highly skilled work done in a highly repetitive way.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Financial Report Generator automates the data assembly, calculation, and narrative generation, freeing FP&A for strategic work.

1. **Automated Data Integration**: Connects to financial systems (ERP, CRM, billing, HRIS) and pulls actuals, budget, and prior-period data automatically.

2. **Report Generation**: Produces standard monthly reports: P&L, balance sheet, cash flow, departmental budgets, revenue analysis, headcount, and KPI dashboards -- all formatted to your templates with accurate calculations.

3. **Intelligent Variance Commentary**: COCO doesn't just calculate "Revenue +12%." It explains why: identifies the drivers (which segments, products, regions contributed), quantifies each driver's impact, and contextualizes against plan assumptions.

4. **Board Deck Assembly**: Generates first-draft board presentations with executive summary, financial highlights, key metrics, risk/opportunity flags, and forward-looking guidance.

5. **Forecast Updates**: Based on actuals-to-date, COCO updates rolling forecasts, highlights tracking vs. plan, and flags items requiring reforecasting.

6. **Anomaly Detection**: Flags unusual patterns in financial data: unexpected account balance changes, budget line items significantly over/under, and trends that deviate from historical patterns.

::: details Pain Point & How COCO Solves It

**The Pain: AP Is the Most Labor-Intensive Function in Finance**

Accounts payable processing is among the most repetitive, error-prone, and underappreciated functions in any organization. The Institute of Financial Operations estimates that manual invoice processing costs $12-15 per invoice when you factor in labor, errors, late fees, and lost early payment discounts.

For a mid-size company processing 3,000+ invoices monthly, that's $36,000-45,000 per month in processing costs alone. The errors -- duplicate payments, incorrect amounts, wrong GL coding -- add another layer of cost through rework, vendor disputes, and audit findings.

The format problem makes automation seem impossible. Invoices arrive via email (PDF attachments), postal mail (scanned paper), supplier portals (various export formats), and increasingly, photos taken on phones. Each vendor has a different layout, terminology, and numbering system. Traditional template-based OCR breaks the moment it encounters an unfamiliar format.

And the matching problem is worse. A vendor named "Widget Corporation Inc." on the PO might appear as "Widget Corp" or "Widget Corp." or "WidgetCo" on the invoice. Line items may be bundled differently: the PO says "100 units of Product A at $10 each" while the invoice says "Product A -- 50 shipped Jan 5, 50 shipped Jan 12, total $1,000." Same transaction, different representation. Humans handle this intuitively. Rules-based systems fail.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Invoice Processor automates the entire AP workflow from receipt to payment.

1. **Intelligent Document Processing**: Reads invoices in any format using advanced OCR and NLP:
   - Extracts vendor name, invoice number, date, line items, quantities, unit prices, tax, and total
   - Handles any layout -- no templates needed for new vendors
   - Reads handwritten notes, stamps, and annotations on paper invoices
   - Processes invoices embedded in email bodies (not just attachments)
   - Handles multi-page invoices and consolidated billing statements

2. **Automated PO Matching**: Fuzzy-matches invoices to purchase orders with intelligence:
   - Handles vendor name variations ("Widget Corp" = "Widget Corporation Inc.")
   - Matches partial deliveries and split shipments to a single PO
   - Reconciles line-item splits (PO says 100 units; invoice says 50+50)
   - Handles pricing variations from contract terms (volume discounts, tiered pricing)
   - Identifies invoices without POs for non-PO workflows (recurring services, utilities)

3. **Three-Way Match**: Compares PO, invoice, and goods receipt at the line-item level:
   - Quantity verification: ordered vs. invoiced vs. received
   - Price verification: agreed price vs. invoiced price
   - Tax calculation: verifies tax amounts against applicable rates
   - Flags specific discrepancies with details: "Line 3: PO price $10.00, Invoice price $10.50, difference $50.00 on 100 units"
   - Tolerance thresholds: auto-approves minor variances within configured limits

4. **GL Account Coding**: Auto-assigns general ledger codes:
   - Based on vendor, expense category, department, and project
   - Learns from historical coding patterns (this vendor always coded to 6100-Marketing)
   - Handles cost center allocation for shared expenses
   - Flags unusual coding for review (same vendor, different GL code than usual)

5. **Approval Routing**: Routes invoices based on configurable rules:
   - Amount thresholds ($0-$5K: auto-approve; $5K-$25K: department head; $25K+: VP)
   - Department and cost center routing
   - Special approval requirements (capital expenses, new vendors, contract changes)
   - Escalation for overdue approvals (reminder at 48h, escalation at 72h)
   - Mobile approval for managers on the go

6. **Payment Optimization**: Schedules payments to maximize value:
   - Captures early payment discounts (2/10 net 30: pay on day 10, save 2%)
   - Maintains cash flow targets (don't pay everything early if cash is tight)
   - Batches payments to reduce transaction costs
   - Prioritizes vendor payments based on relationship importance and terms
   - Forecasts upcoming payment obligations for cash flow planning

::: details Pain Point & How COCO Solves It

**The Pain: Legal Document Drafting Is a Bottleneck Nobody Talks About**

In today's fast-paced enterprise environment, legal document drafting is a bottleneck nobody talks about is a challenge that organizations can no longer afford to ignore. Studies show that teams spend an average of 15-25 hours per week on tasks that could be automated or significantly streamlined. For a mid-size company with 200 employees, this translates to over 100,000 hours of lost productivity annually — equivalent to $4.8M in labor costs that deliver no strategic value.

The problem compounds over time. As teams grow and operations scale, the manual processes that "worked fine" at 20 people become unsustainable at 200. Critical information gets siloed in individual inboxes, spreadsheets, and tribal knowledge. Handoffs between teams introduce delays and errors. And the best employees — the ones you can't afford to lose — burn out fastest because they're the ones most often pulled into the operational firefighting that prevents them from doing their highest-value work. According to a 2025 Deloitte survey, 67% of professionals in enterprise organizations report that manual processes are their biggest barrier to career satisfaction and productivity.

::: details Pain Point & How COCO Solves It

**The Pain: Your Leases Are Ticking Time Bombs of Hidden Costs**

Commercial leases are among the most complex and consequential documents a company signs, yet they receive surprisingly little scrutiny. A typical commercial lease runs 40-80 pages of dense legal language, packed with clauses that can cost or save hundreds of thousands of dollars over the lease term. Most companies have neither the time nor the expertise to review them thoroughly.

The numbers paint a disturbing picture. The average enterprise manages 50-500+ leases across offices, warehouses, retail locations, and equipment. Each lease review takes 15-20 hours of qualified legal or real estate professional time. At $300-$500/hour for outside counsel, that's $4,500-$10,000 per lease review — and that's if it gets reviewed at all. Many companies sign leases with minimal review, trusting the landlord's "standard form."

Hidden clauses are the real cost. Operating expense pass-throughs that include capital improvements. Escalation clauses that compound rather than escalate linearly. Personal guarantee provisions buried in exhibit appendices. CAM (Common Area Maintenance) charges without audit rights. Holdover provisions that charge 150-200% of rent if you stay a single day past expiration. One Fortune 500 company found $3.2M in unfavorable terms across their portfolio simply by auditing leases that had been signed without full review.

Renewal management is another hemorrhage point. With hundreds of leases, critical dates slip through the cracks. Miss a renewal option deadline by one day and you lose negotiating leverage — or worse, you're locked into an above-market renewal at the landlord's terms. Industry data shows that 25-30% of companies miss at least one critical lease date per year, with average financial impact of $50,000-$200,000 per missed deadline.

The comparison problem makes everything harder. Every landlord uses different lease templates, different clause structures, and different terminology for the same concepts. Comparing terms across your portfolio requires manually reading and abstracting every lease — a task so tedious that most companies don't even attempt it, leaving them unable to identify which locations have unfavorable terms or where renegotiation would yield the highest ROI.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Lease Agreement Reviewer acts as your tireless lease analyst, combining legal document understanding with commercial real estate intelligence:

1. **Clause Extraction**: COCO reads the full lease document — regardless of format (PDF, Word, scanned images) — and extracts every material clause into a structured database. This includes rent terms, escalation schedules, operating expense provisions, renewal options, termination rights, tenant improvement allowances, exclusivity clauses, assignment/subletting restrictions, insurance requirements, and dozens more.

2. **Risk Identification**: Each clause is evaluated against a risk framework calibrated to your company's standards. COCO flags above-market escalation rates, missing audit rights, unfavorable holdover terms, excessive landlord remedy provisions, one-sided force majeure clauses, and any clause that deviates significantly from market standard. Each risk gets a severity rating and estimated financial impact over the lease term.

3. **Market Comparison**: COCO compares your lease terms against market benchmarks for the same geography, property type, and lease size. It identifies where you're paying above market, where your terms are weaker than standard, and where there's negotiation opportunity.

4. **Negotiation Recommendations**: For each unfavorable clause, COCO generates specific counter-language with rationale. It prioritizes recommendations by potential financial impact and likelihood of landlord acceptance, giving your team a ready-made negotiation playbook.

5. **Renewal Tracking**: Every critical date — renewal option deadlines, termination notice windows, rent escalation dates, TI allowance deadlines — is extracted and tracked in a centralized calendar. Alerts are sent at 180, 90, 60, and 30 days before each deadline.

6. **Portfolio Analytics**: COCO provides a portfolio-wide view of your lease obligations: total committed rent, escalation projections, upcoming expirations, concentration risk by landlord and geography, and total cost of occupancy benchmarked against industry standards.

::: details Pain Point & How COCO Solves It

**The Pain: Business Travel Is a $1,293-Per-Trip Black Hole**

Business travel is one of the largest controllable expenses for any enterprise, and one of the least controlled. The average domestic business trip costs $1,293 — and that number hasn't decreased despite a decade of "cost optimization" initiatives. With the average mid-size company spending $2-5M annually on travel, even a 10% optimization represents $200-500K in savings hiding in plain sight.

The expense reporting process is where productivity goes to die. Filing a single expense report takes an average of 20 minutes — and that's after the trip, when the employee is already back at their desk with a pile of backed-up work. The result is predictable: 40% of expense reports are submitted late, many with errors or missing receipts. Finance teams then spend 2 weeks per month processing, validating, and chasing down these reports.

Policy compliance is the unspoken disaster. 20% of business expenses don't comply with company travel policy. Employees book premium economy when policy says economy. They choose hotels above the per-diem rate. They expense meals that exceed the limit. Most of this isn't malicious — it's because policies are buried in 30-page documents that nobody reads, and enforcement happens after the money is already spent. Post-trip enforcement creates friction, resentment, and administrative overhead.

Fraud is more common than anyone admits. Industry data suggests that 5-10% of expense reports contain intentional misrepresentations — inflated mileage, personal meals claimed as business, receipts from trips that were partially personal. Traditional audit processes catch only 12% of fraudulent claims because they rely on sampling rather than systematic analysis.

The pre-trip optimization opportunity is almost entirely untapped. Most companies have no system for comparing flight/hotel options against policy constraints in real-time. Employees book what's convenient, not what's optimal. Dynamic pricing means the same trip booked on Tuesday costs 30% less than the same trip booked on Thursday. Without intelligent booking guidance, companies leave 15-25% of potential savings on the table before anyone even boards a plane.

Receipt management is the paper-chase nightmare. Physical receipts get lost, digital receipts sit in email inboxes, and employees spend more time organizing documentation than the expense is worth. For international travel, the complexity multiplies with currency conversions, VAT recovery eligibility, and per-diem variations by country.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Travel Expense Optimizer manages the entire travel lifecycle from booking through reimbursement:

1. **Pre-Trip Cost Optimization**: Before the trip, COCO analyzes travel options and recommends the optimal combination of flights, hotels, and ground transportation based on cost, policy compliance, schedule constraints, and traveler preferences. It monitors price fluctuations and alerts when prices drop for upcoming booked trips, enabling rebooking for savings.

2. **Policy Compliance Checking**: COCO validates every booking and expense against your travel policy in real-time — before money is spent, not after. If an employee selects a hotel above the per-diem rate, COCO explains the policy, suggests compliant alternatives nearby, and routes exceptions for pre-approval when justified.

3. **Receipt Auto-Capture**: Employees snap a photo of any receipt with their phone. COCO's OCR extracts the vendor, amount, date, tax, tip, and category with 99%+ accuracy. For digital receipts, COCO can pull directly from email forwarding. The 20-minute expense report becomes a 2-minute review-and-submit.

4. **Expense Categorization**: Every expense is automatically categorized according to your chart of accounts, allocated to the correct cost center and project code, and tagged with the appropriate tax treatment. No more manual GL coding or miscategorized expenses.

5. **Fraud Detection**: COCO analyzes every expense against historical patterns, looking for anomalies: unusually high amounts for the category, duplicate submissions, weekend expenses on a weekday trip, geographic inconsistencies (hotel in city A, restaurant in city B on same evening), and pattern-based flags like round-number inflation.

6. **Analytics & Benchmarking**: COCO provides spend analytics across departments, trip types, vendors, and time periods. It benchmarks your travel costs against industry standards and identifies specific savings opportunities: preferred vendor agreements, advance booking patterns, and route-specific optimizations.

::: details Pain Point & How COCO Solves It

**The Pain: Board Report Compilation Is a Quarterly Nightmare for Finance Teams**

Every quarter, finance teams across the enterprise world enter what many call "board season" -- a grueling 40-to-60-hour process of compiling board-ready reports that pulls senior finance professionals away from strategic work. The challenge is not just volume; it is the extraordinary precision and polish these documents demand.

A typical board report draws data from 12 or more distinct sources: the ERP system for financial statements, the CRM for pipeline and revenue data, HR platforms for headcount and compensation metrics, project management tools for initiative status, market data feeds for competitive benchmarks, and treasury systems for cash flow and investment positions. Each source has its own format, refresh cadence, and access controls. Finance analysts spend the first two weeks of every quarter simply gathering, reconciling, and normalizing this data.

The reconciliation problem alone is staggering. When revenue figures in the CRM do not match the ERP -- a common occurrence due to timing differences, currency conversions, or recognition rules -- analysts must trace every discrepancy back to its root cause. A single unexplained variance can derail an entire board presentation, because board members are sophisticated enough to spot inconsistencies and will lose confidence in any number they cannot trust.

Then comes the narrative layer. Raw numbers do not tell a story; they need context, trend analysis, and forward-looking commentary. CFOs and controllers spend days crafting the narrative that accompanies the financials -- explaining why EBITDA margins shifted, what drove the change in customer acquisition cost, how headcount growth aligns with the strategic plan. This narrative must be precise (no room for error), balanced (acknowledging both wins and risks), and calibrated to the audience (board members who may have limited operational context).

Formatting is another hidden time sink. Board decks must follow strict templates with consistent fonts, chart styles, color palettes, and page layouts. When multiple contributors work on different sections, formatting drift is inevitable. Someone always uses the wrong chart type, an outdated logo, or inconsistent decimal places. The final formatting pass can take 8-10 hours on its own.

C-suite review adds another 1-2 weeks to the timeline. The CEO, COO, and business unit heads each review their sections, request changes, and sometimes rewrite entire narratives. Version control becomes a nightmare -- "Board_Deck_v7_FINAL_CEO_edits_v2.pptx" is a real filename in most finance departments. Tracking which version incorporates which feedback is manual, error-prone, and stressful.

Finally, there is the scenario analysis gap. Boards increasingly want to see not just what happened, but what could happen under different assumptions. Most finance teams barely have time to produce one base-case forecast, let alone the two or three alternative scenarios that would make the board truly informed. The result is that boards make decisions with incomplete information, and finance teams know it but cannot do better within the time constraints.

The cumulative cost is significant: a mid-size company spends roughly $150,000 per quarter in senior finance labor on board reporting alone. The opportunity cost is even higher -- those same professionals could be driving strategic initiatives, improving forecasting models, or identifying cost-saving opportunities.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Board Report Compiler transforms the quarterly reporting cycle from a marathon into a streamlined, largely automated process.

1. **Automated Data Aggregation**: COCO connects to your financial data sources -- ERP, CRM, HRIS, treasury, market data feeds -- and pulls the latest figures on a scheduled basis. It automatically reconciles cross-system discrepancies by applying your organization's reconciliation rules, flagging only genuine exceptions that require human judgment. Data is normalized into a consistent format with uniform currency conversions, period definitions, and accounting treatments.

2. **KPI Dashboard Generation**: From the aggregated data, COCO builds a comprehensive KPI dashboard covering financial performance (revenue, margins, cash flow), operational metrics (customer counts, churn, NPS), and strategic indicators (market share, competitive positioning). Each KPI includes trend analysis showing quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year changes, with automatic highlighting of metrics that deviate significantly from plan or prior periods.

3. **Narrative Generation**: COCO drafts the commentary sections of the board report, explaining the "why" behind every significant number. It identifies the key drivers of performance changes, connects operational events to financial outcomes, and provides forward-looking context. The narrative is calibrated to your organization's tone and the board's sophistication level. All claims are grounded in the underlying data with precise citations.

4. **Visualization Creation**: Charts, graphs, and tables are generated automatically following your board deck template. COCO selects the appropriate visualization type for each metric (waterfall charts for variance analysis, line charts for trends, heat maps for portfolio performance), applies consistent formatting, and ensures all visual elements meet your brand standards.

5. **Executive Summary Synthesis**: COCO produces a one-page executive summary that captures the quarter's story -- key achievements, challenges, risks, and strategic recommendations. This summary is crafted for busy board members who may only read the first page, ensuring they get the critical information even if they do not review the full deck.

6. **Distribution and Version Management**: COCO manages the review workflow, routing sections to the appropriate executives for approval, tracking changes across versions, maintaining a complete audit trail, and producing the final board-ready package in your preferred format (PDF, PowerPoint, or both). Post-meeting, it archives the final version with all supporting data for future reference.

**Prompt 1: Quarterly Financial Summary with Variance Analysis**
```
You are a senior financial analyst preparing the quarterly board report for [Company Name]. Using the following financial data, create a comprehensive quarterly summary with variance analysis.

Current Quarter Actuals:
- Revenue: [amount]
- COGS: [amount]
- Gross Margin: [percentage]
- Operating Expenses: [amount]
- EBITDA: [amount]
- Net Income: [amount]
- Cash Position: [amount]
- Headcount: [number]

Budget/Plan Figures: [paste budget figures]
Prior Quarter Actuals: [paste prior quarter]
Prior Year Same Quarter: [paste prior year]

For each line item, provide:
1. Actual vs. Budget variance ($ and %) with root cause explanation
2. Quarter-over-quarter trend with commentary on trajectory
3. Year-over-year comparison highlighting structural changes
4. Forward-looking implications for full-year forecast

Flag any variance exceeding 5% from plan as requiring detailed explanation. For each flagged item, provide a 2-3 sentence narrative suitable for board presentation that explains the driver, quantifies the impact, and states the corrective action or expected trajectory.

Format the output as a board-ready narrative with supporting data tables. Use professional, confident tone appropriate for C-suite and board audience.
```

**Prompt 2: Executive Summary One-Pager**
```
Create a board-ready executive summary (one page maximum) for [Company Name]'s Q[X] [Year] board meeting. This must capture the quarter's complete story in a format that a board member can absorb in 3 minutes.

Key inputs:
- Revenue: [actual] vs [plan] ([variance]%)
- Key wins this quarter: [list 3-5 major achievements]
- Key challenges: [list 2-3 significant challenges]
- Strategic initiatives status: [list with RAG status]
- Cash runway: [months]
- Major risks: [list 2-3]
- Key asks of the board: [list any decisions needed]

Structure the summary as:
1. **Quarter Headline**: One sentence capturing the overall quarter narrative
2. **Financial Snapshot**: 4-5 key metrics in a compact table format
3. **Highlights**: Top 3 achievements with quantified impact
4. **Challenges & Mitigations**: Top 2 issues with specific action plans
5. **Strategic Update**: 2-3 sentences on long-term trajectory
6. **Board Actions Requested**: Any decisions or approvals needed

Tone must be: factual, balanced (not spin), forward-looking, and appropriately urgent where warranted. Avoid jargon. Every statement must be supported by a specific number or fact.
```

**Prompt 3: Multi-Scenario Forecast for Board Review**
```
Build three forecast scenarios for [Company Name] covering the next [4/8/12] quarters, suitable for board-level strategic discussion.

Base assumptions:
- Current ARR: [amount]
- Growth rate trailing 4 quarters: [percentage]
- Gross margin: [percentage]
- Monthly burn rate: [amount]
- Cash position: [amount]
- Key growth drivers: [list]
- Key risk factors: [list]

Create three scenarios:

**Base Case** (Most Likely - 60% probability):
- Assumptions: [maintain current trajectory with specific adjustments]
- Quarterly P&L projections
- Cash flow projections
- Key milestones and inflection points

**Upside Case** (Optimistic - 20% probability):
- Assumptions: [specify what goes right -- new deal closes, expansion succeeds, etc.]
- Same financial projections
- What triggers this scenario and early indicators to watch

**Downside Case** (Conservative - 20% probability):
- Assumptions: [specify risks -- market slowdown, churn increase, deal slippage]
- Same financial projections
- Mitigation strategies and trigger points for action

For each scenario, provide: quarterly revenue, EBITDA, cash balance, headcount, and 2-3 scenario-specific KPIs. Include a summary comparison table and a recommendation on which strategic bets are robust across all three scenarios.
```

**Prompt 4: KPI Dashboard Narrative Commentary**
```
Write the narrative commentary section for our quarterly KPI dashboard. Each KPI needs a 3-4 sentence explanation suitable for board members who may not have operational context.

KPI Data (current quarter vs prior quarter vs plan):

Financial KPIs:
- ARR: [current] / [prior] / [plan]
- Net Revenue Retention: [current]% / [prior]% / [plan]%
- CAC: $[current] / $[prior] / $[plan]
- LTV/CAC Ratio: [current] / [prior] / [plan]
- Gross Margin: [current]% / [prior]% / [plan]%

Operational KPIs:
- Total Customers: [current] / [prior] / [plan]
- Logo Churn Rate: [current]% / [prior]% / [plan]%
- NPS Score: [current] / [prior] / [plan]
- Average Response Time: [current] / [prior] / [plan]
- Employee Headcount: [current] / [prior] / [plan]

For each KPI, write commentary that:
1. States the current value and direction (improving/declining/stable)
2. Explains the primary driver of any change from prior quarter
3. Contextualizes performance against plan (on track, ahead, behind)
4. Provides a forward-looking statement about expected trajectory

Use precise language. Replace vague terms like "significant" with specific numbers. Board members should understand exactly what happened and why after reading each commentary block.
```

**Prompt 5: Board Meeting Preparation Package**
```
Prepare a complete board meeting preparation package for [Company Name]'s upcoming board meeting on [date]. I need the following documents generated from the data I will provide.
