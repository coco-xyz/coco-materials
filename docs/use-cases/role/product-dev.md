# Product / Dev Use Cases

AI employees for product managers, developers, and engineering teams.

## AI Code Reviewer
**Pain:** PRs bottleneck senior devs — every review takes 4 hours, 12-PR backlog is normal.
**Solution:** COCO auto-reviews every PR: bugs, security, performance, style — complete report in 15 minutes.
**Result:** 4 hours → 15 minutes. PR backlog: 12 → 0. Dev cycle shortened 70%.

## AI Test Generator
**Pain:** Nobody wants to write unit tests. Coverage at 34%, bugs ship to production.
**Solution:** AI reads source code, generates comprehensive tests with edge cases in 30 minutes.
**Result:** Coverage: 34% → 89%. Production bugs down 60%.

## AI Deploy Monitor
**Pain:** 3am incident pages. Engineer spends an hour diagnosing, then manually rolls back.
**Solution:** AI watches every deployment, detects anomalies in 90 seconds, auto-rollbacks.
**Result:** MTTR: 47min → 2min. 3am pages: 12/month → 0.

## AI API Doc Writer
**Pain:** API docs always outdated. 20 new endpoints with zero documentation.
**Solution:** AI reads codebase, generates complete docs with examples, auto-updates on every merge.
**Result:** 1 week manual → 2 hours. API support tickets down 73%.

## AI Debug Assistant
**Pain:** Production errors = 2 hours digging through logs across 6 dashboards.
**Solution:** AI analyzes logs, correlates across services, identifies root cause and exact line of code.
**Result:** 2 hours → 10 minutes. Time to root cause reduced 92%.
