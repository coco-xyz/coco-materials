**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: Treasury analyst manually pulling data from 6 different systems at 10pm. A revolving credit draw happening that could have been avoided.
[Voiceover]: "Your cash forecast is built from 6 systems, takes 8 hours a week — and it's still 20% off. That's costing you real money."

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: A cash forecast showing $2.3M in week 4. No range. No scenario. The actual comes in at $1.6M — revolving credit draw triggered. Interest meter running.
[Voiceover]: "71% of treasury teams say their cash forecasting is inadequate. A 10% error on $20M monthly cash flow is $200K misallocated. Unnecessary revolving draws at 7.5% interest add up fast."
