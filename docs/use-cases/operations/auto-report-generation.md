# Auto Report Generation

> **Role:** Admin Assistant | **Industry:** Universal | **Scenario:** Workflow Automation

## Pain Point

Teams spend 30-60 minutes per person per day manually compiling daily reports. Data is scattered across project tools, chat logs, and databases. Reports are inconsistent, often delayed, and nobody enjoys writing them.

**The math:** A 10-person team wastes 5 hours/day — that's 100+ hours/month on copy-paste summaries.

## AI Employee Solution

Your AI digital employee automatically:
- **Pulls data** from project management tools, chat logs, databases, and calendars
- **Formats** everything into a clean, consistent daily/weekly report using your template
- **Delivers** the report to Lark, Telegram, Slack, or email on schedule (e.g., every day at 6 PM)

## Before vs After

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Time per person | 30 min/day | 2 min (review only) |
| Team of 10 | 5 hours/day wasted | 20 min total |
| Report quality | Inconsistent, often late | Uniform, always on time |
| Data coverage | Incomplete (manual recall) | Complete (auto-pull all sources) |

## ROI

- **90% time saved** on report writing
- **100% on-time delivery** — zero missed deadlines
- **Better decisions** — reports include data humans often forget to include

## Marketing Angle

Almost every company requires daily/weekly reports. The pain is universal and deeply felt. This use case resonates across all industries and roles.
