**Role**: Accounts Payable / Controller / Finance Ops | **Industry**: Enterprise, Any | **Task**: Automation

## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Finance reviews 5% of expense reports; policy violations average $1,200 per employee per year undetected**

Finance reviews 5% of expense reports; policy violations average $1,200 per employee per year undetected. This isn't just an inconvenience — it's a measurable drag on the business. Teams that face this challenge report spending an average of 15-30 hours per week on manual workarounds that could be automated.

The real cost goes beyond the immediate time waste. When accounts payables are stuck in reactive mode, strategic work doesn't happen. Opportunities are missed. Competitors who have solved this problem move faster, ship sooner, and serve customers better.

Most teams have tried to address this with a combination of spreadsheets, manual processes, and good intentions. The problem is that these approaches don't scale. What works for 10 items breaks at 100. What works for 100 collapses at 1,000. And in today's environment, you're dealing with thousands.
