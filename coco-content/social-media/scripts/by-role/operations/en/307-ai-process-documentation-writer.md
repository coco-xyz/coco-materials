# #307 - AI Process Documentation Writer — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Operations / Documentation
**Metric**: 60% of SOPs incomplete → 3–5x more documentation in same time

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: A new hire staring blankly at a shared drive filled with outdated, half-finished process documents. A senior colleague sighs and says "just ask me."
[Voiceover]: "When your process docs are a mess, your best employees become the manual."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Operations manager attempting to write an SOP, surrounded by sticky notes and half-remembered workflows. A compliance auditor flags a missing document. An employee makes a costly error because no procedure existed.
[Voiceover]: "Over 60% of enterprise SOPs are incomplete or out of date. Every undocumented process is a training gap, a compliance risk, and a single point of failure waiting to happen."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: User describes a process in rough, plain language to COCO. COCO asks targeted follow-up questions, then produces a fully structured SOP with roles, steps, decision points, exception handling, and a version history table.
[Voiceover]: "Just describe the process to COCO — even in rough notes. COCO asks the right clarifying questions, then writes a complete, audit-ready SOP in minutes. Need a checklist version? Done. Need it updated after a process change? Done."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: New employee following a clear SOP, auditor reviewing well-structured documents with approval, operations manager closing a laptop with satisfaction.
[Voiceover]: "Onboarding 50% faster. Audits with confidence. Knowledge that stays when people leave — build your documentation practice at coco.xyz"
