## Script

### HOOK (0-5s)
**[On screen: Terminal / chat interface]**

"What if you could ship an entire MVP... in 30 minutes?"

---

### SETUP (5-15s)
**[On screen: Single chat message being typed]**

"Last night, I gave my AI one instruction:

*'Set up an agent team. Design the product and ship the MVP.'*

That's it. One message."

---

### THE BUILD (15-35s)
**[On screen: Agent team spinning up — show 4 agents appearing]**

"Instantly, 4 AI agents spun up and started working in parallel:

Agent 1 — wrote the full PRD. 12 sections.

Agent 2 — designed the technical architecture. 10 sections.

Agent 3 — built the Chrome Extension. 18 source files.

Agent 4 — built the backend API. 10 source files."

**[On screen: Show the agents working simultaneously, code appearing]**

"Design phase first, then implementation — all with automatic dependency management."

---

### THE RESULT (35-50s)
**[On screen: Final delivery summary with checkmarks]**

"30 minutes later, I had a complete working product:

- Full PRD
- Technical design doc
- A Chrome Extension with screenshot annotation, element selection, and AI analysis
- A backend API with authentication, database, and GitHub integration

28 source files. Zero meetings. Zero context switching."

---

### THE POINT (50-65s)
**[On screen: Before/after comparison]**

"This would normally take a team of 4 engineers... one to two weeks.

With an AI agent team — one person, one instruction, 30 minutes.

This isn't a demo. This is how I actually build software now."

---

### CTA (65-75s)
**[On screen: Logo / link]**

"The future of software development is multi-agent teams.

Link in bio."

---

## B-Roll / Visual Suggestions

1. **Opening**: Dark terminal screen, cursor blinking
2. **Agent spin-up**: 4 avatar icons appearing one by one (like the chat mockup)
3. **Building montage**: Quick cuts of code scrolling, files being created
4. **Delivery**: Clean summary screen with green checkmarks
5. **Comparison**: Split screen — left (old way: meetings, tickets, PRs) vs right (new way: one message → done)

## Text Overlays

- "1 instruction"
- "4 AI agents"
- "30 minutes"
- "28 source files"
- "0 meetings"

## Music

Upbeat, tech-forward, builds in intensity during the build section. Drops to minimal during the result reveal.

## Shorter Version (30s — for TikTok/Reels)

**[0-5s]** "I shipped an entire MVP in 30 minutes."

**[5-15s]** "One instruction → 4 AI agents spun up. PRD writer, architect, frontend dev, backend dev. All working in parallel."

**[15-25s]** "30 minutes later: Chrome Extension, API server, full documentation. 28 source files."

**[25-30s]** "This is how I build software now. Multi-agent teams."
