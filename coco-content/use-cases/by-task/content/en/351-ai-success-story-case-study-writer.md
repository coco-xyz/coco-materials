## Introduction

**The Pain: Customer Wins Go Undocumented While the Sales Cycle Pays the Price**

Customer case studies are among the highest-value assets in a SaaS company's content library — yet they are chronically underpopulated. Sales teams routinely identify "we don't have enough case studies" as one of their top content gaps, particularly for specific verticals, use cases, or company sizes where prospects want proof before advancing in the buying process. The content that would address this gap exists — it lives in the successful outcomes CS teams see every day with customers who have achieved significant measurable results. The problem is not a shortage of customer wins; it is a shortage of the organizational capacity to capture those wins in a publication-ready format.

The production gap is structural. Creating a high-quality case study requires: identifying the customer and outcome, securing executive sponsorship for participation, designing and conducting a customer interview, extracting the relevant quantitative results, writing a compelling narrative that speaks to the right buyer persona, getting legal review, obtaining customer approval on the content, and then formatting it for multiple distribution contexts (web page, PDF, slide excerpt, social media). This is a 4-8 hour process for a skilled writer who has all the inputs — and CS teams have neither the writing capacity nor the process infrastructure to run this workflow at volume. The result is that organizations with hundreds of successful customers can point to a case study library of 8-15 published pieces, almost all of which are over 18 months old.

The opportunity cost of this gap is measured in delayed deals and lower close rates. Research on B2B buying behavior consistently shows that 73% of enterprise buyers consider case studies and customer success stories "very important" or "critical" in their evaluation process. Buyers in late-stage evaluation are seeking evidence that the product works for organizations like theirs — with similar size, industry, use case, or technical environment. Without that evidence, the burden falls on the sales rep to make the case verbally, and the close rate drops measurably against competitors who have relevant customer proof. Every undocumented customer win is a missed opportunity to accelerate pipeline.

The structural challenge for CS teams specifically is the interview dependency. The most compelling case study content comes from the customer's own voice — their description of the problem they were trying to solve, the results they achieved, and why they would recommend the product to peers. Getting that content requires scheduling time with busy customer executives, preparing thoughtful questions, conducting the conversation, and then synthesizing the output into quotable content. CS managers have customer relationships that make this interview access possible — but they rarely have the content skills or bandwidth to convert the interview into publication-ready copy, and when marketing asks for the draft, it doesn't arrive.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO compresses the case study production cycle — enabling CS teams to convert customer win data, interview notes, and outcome information into publication-ready drafts in a fraction of the time required by traditional production processes.

1. **Win Identification and Story Qualification**: COCO helps CS teams identify which customer wins have the strongest case study potential — based on outcome measurability, customer reference likelihood, vertical relevance, and use case coverage gaps in the existing library.
   - Generates case study candidate scoring based on story quality dimensions
   - Identifies which vertical, size, or use case gaps in the library each candidate win would fill

2. **Customer Interview Question Design**: COCO designs tailored interview question guides for each case study — crafted to extract the specific quotes, metrics, and narrative elements needed to build a compelling story around the customer's specific situation and outcome.
   - Creates structured interview guides with primary and follow-up questions
   - Provides question framing guidance that elicits specific, quotable responses

3. **Story Structure Development from Notes**: COCO converts raw interview notes, email exchanges, and outcome data into a structured story — identifying the key narrative elements (before state, catalyst, solution approach, outcomes achieved) and building the case study arc.
   - Transforms bullet-pointed notes and raw data into coherent narrative
   - Identifies the most compelling proof points and ensures they are highlighted

4. **Multi-Format Case Study Production**: COCO produces the case study in multiple formats from a single content input — generating a long-form web version, a one-page PDF summary, a 3-slide presentation excerpt, and a social media pull quote set.
   - Adapts content for different format requirements without requiring separate drafting
   - Maintains consistent messaging and key metrics across all format variations

5. **Customer Approval-Ready Draft Preparation**: COCO produces drafts that are formatted and calibrated for the customer review process — clear, accurate, non-hyperbolic, and framed in language that protects the customer's interests while showcasing their results.
   - Produces review-ready content that minimizes customer change requests
   - Generates cover notes for customer review submissions that set expectations and expedite approval

6. **Sales Enablement Packaging**: COCO produces the sales enablement version of each case study — adding battle card context, identifying the best use cases for each story in the sales process, and generating an internal summary that helps sales reps deploy the asset effectively.
   - Creates rep briefing notes for each case study with deployment guidance
   - Generates objection-handling excerpts tailored from customer success metrics

**Measurable Results**

- **Production cycle time**: Case study production from interview notes to approval-ready draft reduced from 3-6 weeks to 3-5 days when COCO handles drafting
- **Publication volume**: CS teams using COCO for case study production increase annual case study output by 3-5x without adding writing headcount
- **Sales impact**: Deals where relevant case studies were shared in late-stage evaluation show 18-22% higher close rates vs. deals without relevant customer proof
- **Customer approval rate**: Approval-ready drafts produced with COCO achieve 85% first-draft approval rate, vs. 40-50% for drafts produced through traditional routes
- **Library coverage**: Organizations that systematize case study production through CS teams fill an average of 4-6 critical vertical or use case library gaps per year

**Who Benefits**

- **Customer Success Managers** who have the customer relationships and access to outcome data needed to produce case studies, but lack the content production skills and time to convert those inputs into publishable assets
- **Content and Product Marketing Teams** who are responsible for case study production but are bottlenecked by the interview dependency on CS relationships and the slow approval cycles from customers
- **Sales Teams** who need a growing library of relevant customer proof to deploy in late-stage evaluations — particularly for specific verticals, company sizes, or use cases where prospects are skeptical
- **CS Leaders and VP CS** who want to demonstrate the tangible value their function creates for customers in a format that generates organizational visibility and supports the CS team's internal positioning

## Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1 — Full case study draft from interview notes**
```
I just completed a customer interview and need to turn my notes into a case study draft. Here is the raw material:

Company: [Name, industry, size — e.g., "Acme Corp, a 500-person manufacturing company in the Midwest"]
Interviewee: [Title — e.g., "VP Operations"]
Product/use case: [What they use our product for]
Contract start: [Date]

Key points from the interview (paste raw notes):
- Problem before our product: [notes]
- Why they chose us: [notes]
- Implementation experience: [notes]
- Results achieved: [specific metrics if shared — e.g., "reduced processing time from 4 hours to 45 minutes", "saved $200K in the first year"]
- Favorite features or aspects: [notes]
- Quotes I captured: [paste any verbatim quotes]
- Would they recommend us? [notes on how they expressed this]

Please draft a full case study (600-800 words) with:
1. A compelling headline that leads with the outcome
2. A "challenge" section that describes the before-state in the customer's terms
3. A "solution" section describing how they implemented and use the product
4. A "results" section with all quantified outcomes prominently featured
5. 2-3 pull quotes attributed to the interviewee
6. A closing recommendation statement

Write in a professional but human voice — not a press release. The customer should feel proud to share this.
```

**Prompt 2 — Customer interview question guide**
```
I am scheduling a case study interview with [Job Title] at [Customer Name, a company that achieved: describe key result, e.g., "reduced customer onboarding time by 65% using our product"]. I want to come prepared with questions that will draw out the most compelling story elements.

Our product: [brief description]
Their use case: [how they use it]
Known results: [what we know about their outcomes]
Buyer persona for the case study: [who will read this — e.g., "VP Operations at mid-size manufacturing companies"]

Please design an interview guide with:
1. 3 opening questions to establish context and the "before state" (what was life like before our product?)
2. 4 questions about the decision and implementation process (why us, what was implementation like, what surprised them)
3. 4 questions about results (with prompts to get specific metrics, not just general positive sentiment)
4. 2 questions that draw out quotable recommendations (what would they tell a peer in a similar situation?)
5. 1 closing question about what they wish they had known before starting

For each question, add: what information we're trying to get, and a follow-up prompt if they give a vague answer.
```

**Prompt 3 — One-page case study summary**
```
I have a long-form case study (paste the full text below) and need to create a one-page summary version for use in sales presentations and PDF handouts.

[Paste full case study]

Please create a one-page case study formatted for PDF with:
1. Company and logo header with key stats (company size, industry, product used)
2. A 2-3 sentence "About" section
3. "The Challenge" — 3-4 bullet points summarizing the problem
4. "The Solution" — 3-4 bullet points describing what they did with our product
5. "The Results" — a metrics box prominently featuring 3-4 key quantified outcomes
6. 1 featured pull quote from the customer
7. A 1-sentence closing recommendation from the customer

Format as clearly labeled sections with enough white space for a clean PDF layout. Keep total word count under 350 words.
```

**Prompt 4 — Social media and sales asset pull quotes**
```
Based on the following case study content, please generate a set of social media and sales enablement assets:

[Paste case study content]

Please produce:
1. LinkedIn post: a 200-word post from our company account announcing this customer story — with a hook that makes the result clear in the first line (for mobile readers who see only the first 2 lines)
2. 5 pull quotes: short, quotable excerpts (under 30 words each) from the customer that could be used as slide callouts or social media quotes
3. Tweet-length result statement: 280 characters max, leading with the outcome metric
4. Sales rep internal summary: a 5-bullet briefing on "when to use this case study in your deals" — which prospect types, deal stages, and objections it addresses most effectively
5. Email snippet: a 3-sentence version of the customer story that a sales rep can paste into a prospecting or follow-up email

Format each asset separately with a clear label.
```

**Prompt 5 — Win story extraction from QBR notes**
```
I just completed a quarterly business review with [Customer Name] and there is a strong success story in the notes, but I haven't had time to write it up. I want to capture it as both a case study candidate and an internal win story before the details get lost.

QBR notes (paste raw): [paste your notes from the QBR, including customer statements, metrics shared, and any positive outcomes discussed]

Additional context:
- Customer size and industry: [details]
- Their primary use case: [details]
- Contract value: [$X]
- How long they've been a customer: [X months/years]
- Whether they would participate in a case study: [yes/no/maybe — and any conditions they mentioned]

Please produce:
1. A structured win story summary (internal, 200 words) that captures the key outcome for our internal wins Slack channel or sales enablement library
2. An assessment of whether this is a strong case study candidate — and if so, what additional information we'd need to gather in a follow-up interview
3. If they're willing to participate: a case study outreach email I can send to their executive sponsor to formally request their participation, with clear expectations on time commitment and review process
4. Key metrics to highlight: a list of the quantified results mentioned in the QBR that should anchor the case study story
```
