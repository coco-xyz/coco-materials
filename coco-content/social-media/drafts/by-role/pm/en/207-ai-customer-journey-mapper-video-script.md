# Video Script: AI Customer Journey Mapper
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "Your journey map is on a Miro board, built from sticky notes six months ago. Meanwhile your real user journey — messy, non-linear, leaking revenue at every undetected drop-off — is scattered across Analytics, Intercom, NPS surveys, and app store reviews. Nobody has time to stitch it together."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows a workshop whiteboard journey map vs. actual user paths diverging wildly, right side shows 5,000 trial users losing 400 at an invisible onboarding step. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "Manual journey mapping takes 3-4 weeks and draws from 1-2 data sources. Teams surface assumptions — not evidence — and miss 40% of their actual drop-off points while the revenue leak continues."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Multi-source data fusion reconciling behavioral analytics, CRM, surveys, and qualitative research into a unified journey model
  - Drop-off quantification and root cause analysis distinguishing "not yet" abandonment from permanent churn at each stage
  - Persona-specific journey branching revealing that your "single" journey actually contains multiple distinct paths
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Customer Journey Mapper synthesizes 6-8 data sources into a grounded, evidence-backed journey map in 2-3 days — surfacing 40% more previously invisible drop-off points. No workshop required."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "Journey mapping time drops from 3-4 weeks to 2-3 days. Onboarding conversion improves 15-25% with data-grounded maps. Cross-functional alignment meetings cut from 3 sessions to 1 — because now everyone's looking at the same evidence."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
