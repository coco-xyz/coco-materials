**Category**: Operations / Compliance
**Metric**: Policy violations detected after the fact → 70% earlier detection

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: Auditor presenting a finding — expense approvals missing receipts, procurement bypassed policy, a data sharing incident. Operations manager looking caught off guard.
[Voiceover]: "You find out about policy violations during the audit. That's already too late."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Stacks of expense reports, procurement decisions, vendor contracts — all needing compliance review. A single overwhelmed operations manager. The alternative: nothing gets reviewed until audit time.
[Voiceover]: "46% of organizations experience internal fraud or policy failures every two years. With hundreds of policies and thousands of transactions, manual compliance checking is impossible. So nothing gets checked — until it's a problem."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: Operations manager submitting a batch of expense reports to COCO with the relevant policy. COCO flags three high-risk items with specific policy citations. A compliance risk score appears. COCO also identifies a policy gap where the data sharing policy hasn't been updated for cloud tools.
[Voiceover]: "Feed COCO your policies and the documents you need to review. It checks every item against every applicable provision, flags violations with specific citations, scores the batch by risk level, and identifies where your policies need updating — before the auditors do."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: Clean audit results on screen. Operations manager presenting a well-documented compliance review trail. Internal fraud risk assessment showing significant decrease.
[Voiceover]: "Catch violations 70% earlier. Build an audit trail automatically. Make compliance proactive — start at coco.xyz"
