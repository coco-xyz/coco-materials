## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Static threshold alerts miss gradual anomalies and create alert fatigue with 200+ false alarms per week**

Static threshold alerts miss gradual anomalies and create alert fatigue with 200+ false alarms per week. This isn't just an inconvenience — it's a measurable drag on the business. Teams that face this challenge report spending an average of 15-30 hours per week on manual workarounds that could be automated.

The real cost goes beyond the immediate time waste. When data engineers are stuck in reactive mode, strategic work doesn't happen. Opportunities are missed. Competitors who have solved this problem move faster, ship sooner, and serve customers better.

Most teams have tried to address this with a combination of spreadsheets, manual processes, and good intentions. The problem is that these approaches don't scale. What works for 10 items breaks at 100. What works for 100 collapses at 1,000. And in today's environment, you're dealing with thousands.

**How COCO Solves It**

1. **Learns normal patterns across**: Learns normal patterns across all metrics and detects deviations automatically. COCO handles this end-to-end, requiring minimal configuration and zero ongoing maintenance. The system learns from your specific patterns and improves over time.

2. **Distinguishes real anomalies from**: Distinguishes real anomalies from seasonality, trends, and one-offs. COCO handles this end-to-end, requiring minimal configuration and zero ongoing maintenance. The system learns from your specific patterns and improves over time.

3. **Identifies root cause by**: Identifies root cause by correlating anomalies across related metrics. COCO handles this end-to-end, requiring minimal configuration and zero ongoing maintenance. The system learns from your specific patterns and improves over time.

**Measurable Results**

- **Detection Time**: 5 days → 12 min
- **False Alarms**: 200/wk → 8/wk
- **Revenue Protected**: $890K/year
- **Team satisfaction**: Significant improvement reported
- **Time to value**: Results visible within first week
- **ROI payback**: Typically under 30 days
