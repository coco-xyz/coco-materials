**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: New hire's first day — given a company handbook, an IT ticket, and a wave goodbye
[Voiceover]: "A PDF and a help desk ticket isn't an onboarding plan. And your new hire knows it."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Employee looking lost in week 3, browsing job boards from their work laptop, manager looking surprised when they resign
[Voiceover]: "Poor onboarding doubles the chance of early attrition. Only 12% of employees say their company actually nails it. The cost of a mis-hire? Up to 200% of their annual salary — before they've had time to contribute."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: HR entering role context, team, and stakeholders into COCO, a full 30-60-90 day onboarding plan appearing — with milestones, stakeholder meetings, manager check-ins, training path
[Voiceover]: "Tell COCO the role, team, and priorities. Get a complete 30-60-90 day onboarding plan — with stakeholder maps, training sequences, and check-in schedules — personalized to each hire."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: New hire confidently presenting in week 8, shaking hands with colleagues, manager giving thumbs up
[Voiceover]: "34% faster time to productivity. 28% better 90-day retention. Under 1 hour of prep. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
