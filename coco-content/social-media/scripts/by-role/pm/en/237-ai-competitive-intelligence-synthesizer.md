# #237 - AI Competitive Intelligence Synthesizer — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Product Manager / Research
**Metric**: 8-12 hours quarterly competitive research → under 2 hours, 4x signal coverage

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: A PM staring at a competitor's G2 review page, then switching tabs to a stale slide deck labeled "Competitive Landscape — Updated Q2 2023"
[Voiceover]: "Your competitor just shipped a feature your customers have been begging for. You had no idea it was coming."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Split screen — a competitor's changelog announcement, a Slack thread saying "we just lost the Acme deal," and a PM buried in browser tabs
[Voiceover]: "Competitive intelligence in most product teams is six months old, covers three sources, and lives in a slide deck nobody updates. The average PM only reviews 20-30 competitive signals per quarter — while 300+ are hiding in plain sight. The result? Feature gap blindness that costs 2.3x more in lost deals than the cost of building the feature would have been."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: COCO interface showing a live competitive matrix updating, a battlecard being auto-generated, and a "weekly intel digest" notification appearing
[Voiceover]: "COCO continuously monitors competitor review streams, job postings, changelogs, and pricing pages — and synthesizes them into a structured competitive matrix that updates itself. When a competitor ships something material, COCO surfaces it within days — not months — with a recommended response and updated sales battlecard."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: Before/after — left side shows a PM scrambling before a board meeting; right side shows a PM confidently presenting a clean competitive landscape slide
[Voiceover]: "18-24% better win rates against named competitors. Competitive blindspots closed in weeks, not months. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
