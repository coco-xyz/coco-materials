# #288 - AI Content Calendar Planner — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Marketing / Scheduling
**Metric**: 45% schedule adherence → 90%; calendar planning 6 hours → 90 minutes

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: Beautiful content calendar on Monday. Same calendar on Friday — half the slots marked "missed," "delayed," "TBD."
[Voiceover]: "Every content calendar looks great on Monday. By Friday, it's a monument to good intentions."

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Content manager scrambling to find something to post. Blog post from 2 months ago repurposed for the third time. "Why is there nothing ready?!"
[Voiceover]: "45% of planned content never gets published on schedule. Teams build calendars based on what they wish they could produce — not what they actually can. And when the calendar collapses, you're posting whatever's ready, not what your audience needs."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: COCO building a calendar based on team capacity inputs. Realistic schedule: 3 blogs, 12 social posts, 4 emails per month. Specific content ideas generated for each slot. Dynamic reschedule when one piece is delayed.
[Voiceover]: "COCO plans your calendar around what your team can actually produce. It generates specific content ideas for every slot, maps each piece to a buyer journey stage, and automatically adjusts when things shift. Realistic planning. Consistent publishing."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: Publishing consistency dashboard showing 90% adherence. Content strategist planning for next quarter — not firefighting today's gaps.
[Voiceover]: "90% publishing consistency. 60 minutes of planning instead of 6 hours. Content that actually compounds. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
