### #5 - AI Code Reviewer

**Category**: Dev Team / Engineering
**Pain**: PR reviews bottleneck the entire dev cycle — senior devs spend half their day reading other people's code
**Solution**: COCO AI agent reviews every PR automatically — catches bugs, style issues, security flaws, and suggests improvements before a human ever looks at it
**Metric**: 4 hours per PR review cycle → 15 minutes

#### English Social Copy (X/Twitter)

Your senior devs spend 4 hours per PR cycle just reviewing code. That's not engineering — that's babysitting.

We hired an AI code reviewer. It catches bugs, flags security issues, and suggests fixes in 15 minutes.

Senior devs now review AI's summary, not raw diffs.

coco.xyz

#### 中文社媒文案

我们团队之前最大的瓶颈不是写代码，是等Code Review。

一个PR从提交到合并平均4小时，Senior开发一半时间在看别人的代码。

现在我们用COCO的AI Code Reviewer：
- 自动扫描每个PR
- 15分钟出完整review报告
- Bug、安全漏洞、代码风格全覆盖
- Senior只需要看AI的总结，不用逐行读diff

4小时 → 15分钟，Senior的时间终于解放了。

试试看 coco.xyz

#### Video Script (English, 50s)

**Scene 1 (0-10s): Hook**
[Visual]: Split screen — left side shows a developer staring at a massive PR diff (2,400 lines changed), right side shows a clock fast-forwarding through 4 hours. Red "BLOCKED" labels appear on 3 other PRs waiting in queue.
[Text]: "Your team's biggest bottleneck isn't writing code. It's reviewing it."
[Subtext]: "Average PR review cycle: 4 hours. That's 50% of senior dev time."

**Scene 2 (10-25s): How It Works**
[Visual]: COCO dashboard — user clicks "Add Agent" and selects "Code Reviewer." Shows the agent connecting to a GitHub repo. A new PR appears and the AI agent instantly starts analyzing. Code scrolls by with green checkmarks and red flags appearing inline.

### #6 - AI Test Generator

**Category**: Dev Team / QA Engineering
**Pain**: Nobody wants to write unit tests — devs skip them, coverage drops, bugs ship to production
**Solution**: COCO AI agent reads your source code and generates comprehensive unit tests automatically — edge cases included
**Metric**: 2 days manual test writing → 30 minutes

#### English Social Copy (X/Twitter)

Your devs skip writing tests because it takes 2 days per module. Then bugs ship to production.

We hired an AI test generator. It reads source code, writes unit tests (edge cases included), and runs them — in 30 minutes.

Code coverage went from 34% to 89%.

coco.xyz

#### 中文社媒文案

说个扎心的事实：我们团队的单元测试覆盖率只有34%。

不是不想写，是真没时间。一个模块的测试要写2天，需求排着队呢。

后来我们用了COCO的AI Test Generator：
- 读取源码，自动生成单元测试
- 包含边界条件和异常处理
- 30分钟覆盖一整个模块
- 生成的测试直接能跑

两周后覆盖率从34%飙到89%。线上Bug直接少了60%。

写测试这件事，真的该交给AI了。coco.xyz

#### Video Script (English, 50s)

**Scene 1 (0-10s): Hook**
[Visual]: A code coverage dashboard showing 34% in angry red. A production error alert pops up — "Critical bug in payments module." A developer slumps at their desk.
[Text]: "Your test coverage is 34%. You know it. Your team knows it. Your customers definitely know it."
[Subtext]: "Manual test writing: 2 days per module. Nobody has time."

**Scene 2 (10-25s): How It Works**
[Visual]: COCO dashboard — "AI Test Generator" agent is active. User points it at a repository. The agent opens a source file, analyzes function signatures, logic branches, and dependencies. Test files appear one by one — each with descriptive test names, setup/teardown, and edge case assertions.
[Text]: "COCO's AI Test Generator reads your source code, understands the logic, and writes complete unit tests — including edge cases, error handling, and mocking. Point it at a module, come back in 30 minutes."

**Scene 3 (25-40s): Results**
[Visual]: Before: Coverage badge 34% (red), Jira board full of production bugs. After: Coverage badge 89% (green), clean Jira board. Side-by-side: "Test writing time: 2 days → 30 minutes." Production bug count chart drops 60%.
[Text]: "Coverage jumped from 34% to 89% in two weeks. Production bugs dropped 60%. Developers finally stopped dreading the words 'write tests for this.'"

### #7 - AI Deploy Monitor

**Category**: DevOps / SRE
**Pain**: Production goes down at 3am, the on-call engineer gets paged, spends an hour figuring out what broke, then manually rolls back
**Solution**: COCO AI agent watches every deployment in real time — detects anomalies, diagnoses the issue, and auto-rollbacks before your team even wakes up
**Metric**: 3am manual incident response → fully automated detection + rollback

#### English Social Copy (X/Twitter)

Your on-call engineer got paged at 3am. Spent an hour finding the bad deploy. Rolled back manually. Went back to sleep at 5am.

Our AI deploy monitor catches bad deploys in 90 seconds and auto-rollbacks. Zero human intervention.

coco.xyz

#### 中文社媒文案

凌晨3点，线上告警响了。

On-call工程师被叫醒，花1小时定位问题，手动回滚，5点才睡回去。第二天顶着黑眼圈上班。

这种事在我们团队每周发生2-3次。

现在我们用COCO的AI Deploy Monitor：
- 实时监控每次部署
- 90秒内检测异常（错误率、延迟、内存泄漏）
- 自动诊断根因
- 自动执行回滚，零人工干预
- 第二天早上看报告就行

On-call不再是噩梦了。工程师终于能睡个好觉。

coco.xyz

#### Video Script (English, 50s)

**Scene 1 (0-10s): Hook**
[Visual]: Dark bedroom, 3:17am on the clock. Phone buzzes with a PagerDuty alert. Developer groggily picks up the phone. Alert reads: "Error rate spike — payments service — CRITICAL."
[Text]: "3am. PagerDuty goes off. Your engineer just lost another night of sleep."
[Subtext]: "Average incident response: 47 minutes. Average sleep lost: priceless."

**Scene 2 (10-25s): How It Works**
[Visual]: COCO dashboard with "Deploy Monitor" agent active. A deployment is triggered — the agent watches real-time metrics (error rate, p99 latency, memory usage). At 90 seconds post-deploy, error rate spikes. The agent flags it, identifies the bad commit, and initiates auto-rollback. Green checkmark appears: "Rollback complete."
[Text]: "COCO's AI Deploy Monitor watches every deployment in real time. Error rate spike? It detects it in 90 seconds, identifies the root cause, and auto-rollbacks — before your team even knows something happened."

**Scene 3 (25-40s): Results**
[Visual]: Before: Tired engineer at 3am, incident timeline showing 47 minutes to resolution. After: Engineer sleeping peacefully, Slack message at 7am reading "Incident auto-resolved at 3:18am. Report attached." Metrics: "MTTR: 47 min → 2 min" and "3am pages: 12/month → 0."
[Text]: "Mean time to recovery dropped from 47 minutes to 2 minutes. 3am pages went to zero. Our engineers sleep through the night, and incidents resolve themselves."

**Scene 4 (40-50s): CTA**

### #8 - AI API Doc Writer

**Category**: Dev Team / Technical Writing
**Pain**: API docs are always outdated because nobody wants to write them — new endpoints ship without docs, and external devs waste hours guessing
**Solution**: COCO AI agent reads your codebase, generates complete API documentation with examples, and keeps it updated with every merge
**Metric**: 1 week of manual documentation → 2 hours

#### English Social Copy (X/Twitter)

"Where are the API docs?" — Every external developer, every integration call.

Your team hasn't updated them in 3 months. It would take a week to write them from scratch.

Our AI doc writer reads the codebase and generates full API docs in 2 hours. With examples.

coco.xyz

#### 中文社媒文案

"接口文档在哪？" —— 每个对接方问的第一句话。

你心里清楚，文档三个月没更新了。新加的20个接口一个字都没写。要补的话至少一周。

我们用COCO的AI API Doc Writer：
- 直接读代码，自动生成接口文档
- 包含参数说明、返回值、错误码
- 自动生成调用示例（curl + SDK）
- 每次代码合并自动更新

1周的文档工作 → 2小时搞定。对接方再也不用来找你问了。

认真的，API文档就该让AI写。coco.xyz

#### Video Script (English, 50s)

**Scene 1 (0-10s): Hook**
[Visual]: Slack messages flooding in — partner developers asking "Where are the docs for the new endpoint?" "Is this field required or optional?" "What's the error format?" A developer sighs and opens a blank Google Doc.
[Text]: "Your API has 47 endpoints. Only 12 are documented. The docs were last updated 3 months ago."
[Subtext]: "Manual documentation: 1 week. Nobody volunteers."

**Scene 2 (10-25s): How It Works**
[Visual]: COCO dashboard — "API Doc Writer" agent connects to a GitHub repo. It scans route files, controllers, middleware, and type definitions. Documentation pages generate in real time — endpoint descriptions, parameter tables, response schemas, error codes, and curl examples all appear. A "Docs Updated" commit pushes automatically.
[Text]: "COCO's AI Doc Writer reads your entire codebase — routes, types, validation rules, error handlers — and generates complete API documentation. Every endpoint, every parameter, every example. And it updates automatically with every merge."

**Scene 3 (25-40s): Results**
[Visual]: Before: Partner dev on a call saying "We can't integrate without docs." After: Beautiful API doc site (like Stripe's docs), partner dev happily coding with docs open. Metrics animate: "1 week → 2 hours" and "Support tickets about API usage: -73%."
[Text]: "Full documentation generated in 2 hours. Support tickets about API usage dropped 73%. Partner onboarding time went from 2 weeks to 2 days."

**Scene 4 (40-50s): CTA**
[Visual]: COCO logo (yellow coconut tree) on clean background

### #9 - AI Debug Assistant

**Category**: Dev Team / Engineering
**Pain**: Production errors hit, and engineers spend 2 hours digging through logs, stack traces, and git blame trying to find the root cause
**Solution**: COCO AI agent analyzes error logs, correlates across services, identifies root cause, and suggests the exact fix — with the line of code
**Metric**: 2 hours debugging → 10 minutes

#### English Social Copy (X/Twitter)

A production error hits. Your engineer opens 6 dashboards, reads 10,000 log lines, and blames 3 commits before finding the bug. 2 hours gone.

Our AI debug assistant finds root cause in 10 minutes. Points to the exact line. Suggests the fix.

coco.xyz

#### 中文社媒文案

**Scene 3 (25-40s): Results**
[Visual]: Before: Engineer with 14 tabs, 2 hours wasted, Slack thread with 30 messages trying to debug together. After: Clean debug report — root cause, affected line, suggested fix, all in one page. Engineer applies the fix in minutes. Metrics: "2 hours → 10 minutes" and "Mean time to root cause: -92%."
[Text]: "Debugging time dropped from 2 hours to 10 minutes. Engineers get a root cause report — not a haystack of logs. Time to root cause reduced by 92%."

**Scene 4 (40-50s): CTA**
[Visual]: COCO logo (yellow coconut tree) on clean background

[Subtext]: "Statistical significance needs volume. 50 variants isn't enough."

**Scene 2 (10-25s): How It Works**
[Visual]: COCO dashboard — "Ad Copy Generator" agent. User inputs: product description, target audience, and campaign goal. The agent generates variants in real time — different emotional angles (fear, aspiration, curiosity), different CTAs (learn more, start free, don't miss out), different tones (formal, casual, urgent). A counter in the corner ticks up: 50... 100... 150... 200 variants. Each variant is tagged by angle and platform format.
[Text]: "Tell COCO your product and audience. In 10 minutes, it generates 200 ad copy variants — different angles, tones, and calls to action. Each tagged and formatted for the platform. Ready to upload directly into your ad manager."
