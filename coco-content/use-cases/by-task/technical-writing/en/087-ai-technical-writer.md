## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Your Documentation Is a Graveyard of Good Intentions**

Developers hate writing docs. This isn't opinion — it's one of the most consistently validated findings in software engineering research. A 2024 Stack Overflow survey found that 91% of developers say documentation at their company is insufficient, incomplete, or outright wrong. Yet the same developers rank good documentation as the single most important factor when evaluating a tool or library. The hypocrisy is universal.

The consequences are brutal. The average developer spends 3.5 hours per week searching for information that should be in the docs but isn't. Multiply that across a 50-person engineering team, and you're burning 9,100 hours per year — the equivalent of 4.5 full-time engineers doing nothing but looking for answers. New hires take 2-3 months longer to become productive when documentation is poor. And when a senior engineer leaves, their undocumented tribal knowledge creates a knowledge black hole that can take years to recover from.

The documentation lag is perhaps the most insidious problem. In a typical fast-moving SaaS company, documentation lags the actual product by 2-6 months. Features ship, APIs change, configurations evolve, but the docs still describe the system as it was last quarter. Developers learn to distrust the docs, which creates a vicious cycle: nobody reads them because they're wrong, and nobody updates them because nobody reads them.

Internal documentation is even worse. Architecture decision records are written once and never updated. Runbooks describe infrastructure that was migrated two years ago. Onboarding guides reference tools the team stopped using. The documentation that does exist is scattered across Notion, Confluence, Google Docs, README files, Slack threads, and individual engineers' personal notes. Finding anything requires asking the right person at the right time.

API documentation is a special category of pain. REST endpoints, GraphQL schemas, WebSocket events, webhook payloads — every integration surface needs accurate, up-to-date documentation with examples. When the API changes and the docs don't, external developers waste hours debugging issues that are actually documentation bugs. For API-first companies, this directly impacts revenue.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Technical Writer integrates into your development workflow and treats documentation as a first-class artifact that evolves with the code. Here's how:

1. **Code-to-Docs Generation**: COCO analyzes your codebase — functions, classes, modules, configurations — and generates human-readable documentation automatically. It doesn't just extract comments; it understands code semantics, infers intent from naming and structure, and produces explanations that make sense to someone who hasn't read the code.

2. **API Reference Auto-Sync**: Connected to your codebase, COCO detects when API endpoints, parameters, response shapes, or error codes change. It automatically updates the API reference documentation, generates new code examples, and flags breaking changes. Your API docs are never more than one deploy behind.

3. **Tutorial Creation**: COCO generates step-by-step tutorials and how-to guides based on common usage patterns it observes in your codebase and support tickets. These aren't generic templates — they reference your actual APIs, use your naming conventions, and follow your established patterns.

4. **Changelog Automation**: Every PR that ships gets automatically analyzed. COCO categorizes changes as features, improvements, bug fixes, or breaking changes, and generates user-facing release notes in plain language. Technical PR descriptions are translated into what customers actually care about.

5. **Search Optimization**: COCO indexes all documentation and optimizes it for discoverability. It adds relevant keywords, cross-references between related topics, and generates FAQ entries based on common search patterns and support tickets. Finding information becomes a 30-second search instead of a 30-minute hunt.

6. **Version Management**: Documentation is versioned alongside your product. COCO maintains documentation branches for each supported version, handles migration guides between versions, and clearly marks deprecated features. Users on older versions see docs relevant to their version.

**Measurable Results**

- **Documentation coverage increased to 95%** from a typical baseline of 34%, eliminating knowledge gaps
- **Docs lag reduced from 3 months to same-day**, ensuring documentation is always current with the product
- **Developer documentation time reduced 82%**, freeing 2.9 hours per developer per week for actual engineering
- **Search success rate improved to 89%** from 41%, meaning developers find answers on the first try
- **New developer onboarding time reduced 56%**, from 12 weeks to 5.3 weeks average for full productivity

**Who Benefits**

- **Engineering Teams**: Accurate, always-current documentation without the toil of writing it manually
- **Developer Relations**: Comprehensive API docs and tutorials that improve developer experience and reduce support load
- **Product Managers**: Automatic changelog generation and feature documentation that keeps stakeholders informed
- **New Hires**: Dramatically faster onboarding with documentation that actually reflects the current state of the system

## Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: API Endpoint Documentation Generator**
```
Generate comprehensive API documentation for the following endpoint:

Endpoint: [method] [path]
Handler code:
[paste the route handler / controller code]

Related models/schemas:
[paste relevant data models or TypeScript interfaces]

Generate documentation including:
1. Endpoint description (what it does and when to use it)
2. Authentication requirements
3. Request parameters (path, query, body) with types, constraints, and descriptions
4. Request body example (realistic, not placeholder data)
5. Response format with all possible status codes (200, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
6. Response body examples for success and each error case
7. Rate limiting information if applicable
8. Code examples in curl, JavaScript (fetch), Python (requests), and Go
9. Common gotchas or edge cases
10. Related endpoints that are commonly used together

Format as OpenAPI 3.0 compatible YAML and as a Markdown reference page.
```

**Prompt 2: Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**
```
Create an Architecture Decision Record for the following technical decision:

Decision: [e.g., "Migrate from REST to GraphQL for the mobile API"]
Context: [describe the situation and constraints]
Team size: [number]
Current system: [brief description of existing architecture]
Key stakeholders: [who is affected]

Generate an ADR following the standard format:
1. Title: ADR-[number]: [descriptive title]
2. Status: [Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded]
3. Context: Detailed problem statement, constraints, and business drivers
4. Decision Drivers: Numbered list of factors that influenced the decision
5. Considered Options: At least 3 alternatives with pros/cons analysis
6. Decision: The chosen option with detailed rationale
7. Consequences: Positive, negative, and neutral consequences
8. Implementation Plan: High-level migration/implementation steps
9. Metrics: How we'll measure if this decision was correct
10. References: Related ADRs, external resources, benchmarks

Write in a factual, objective tone. Future engineers reading this should understand not just WHAT was decided, but WHY.
```

**Prompt 3: Runbook for Production Service**
```
Create a production runbook for the following service:

Service name: [name]
Purpose: [what it does]
Tech stack: [languages, frameworks, databases, cloud services]
Dependencies: [upstream and downstream services]
Current monitoring: [describe existing alerts/dashboards]
On-call rotation: [team/schedule]

Generate a runbook covering:
1. Service Overview: Architecture diagram description, data flow, SLAs
2. Health Checks: How to verify the service is healthy, key metrics to monitor
3. Common Alerts: For each known alert type — what it means, severity, and step-by-step remediation
4. Incident Response: Escalation procedures, communication templates, rollback steps
5. Debugging Guide: How to access logs, traces, and metrics. Common debugging queries
6. Scaling: How to scale up/down, capacity planning guidelines, auto-scaling configuration
7. Deployment: Deploy process, rollback process, feature flag management
8. Disaster Recovery: Backup procedures, data recovery steps, failover process
9. Maintenance: Regular maintenance tasks, database migrations, dependency updates
10. Contact List: Team members with areas of expertise

Include copy-pasteable commands for all operations. No engineer should need tribal knowledge to operate this service at 3 AM.
```

**Prompt 4: SDK Quick Start Guide**
```
Write a developer-friendly Quick Start guide for our SDK/API. Target audience: experienced developers who are new to our platform.

Product: [name]
Primary use case: [what developers build with it]
SDK language: [language]
Authentication method: [API key, OAuth, etc.]
Base URL: [endpoint]

Structure the guide as:
1. Prerequisites (2-3 sentences, not a wall of requirements)
2. Installation (single command, package manager)
3. Authentication setup (minimal steps to get a working API key)
4. "Hello World" example (simplest possible working example, under 20 lines)
5. Common use case #1 (realistic example with explanation)
6. Common use case #2 (slightly more advanced)
7. Error handling patterns (show how to handle the 3 most common errors)
8. Next steps (links to full reference, examples repo, community)

Rules: No jargon without explanation. Every code block must be copy-pasteable and actually work. Show output/response for every example. Total length: under 1500 words. A developer should go from zero to working code in under 10 minutes.
```

**Prompt 5: Codebase Documentation Audit**
```
Audit the documentation coverage and quality of this codebase/module:

Repository: [name/URL]
Primary language: [language]
Module being audited: [specific directory or component]
Code files: [paste key files or directory listing]
Existing docs: [paste any existing README, comments, or docs]

Evaluate and report on:
1. README quality: Does it explain what the project does, how to install, how to use? Score 1-10
2. Code comments: Ratio of commented to uncommented functions. Identify the 10 most critical undocumented functions
3. API documentation: Are all public interfaces documented? List undocumented ones
4. Architecture docs: Is there a high-level system overview? If not, generate one from the code structure
5. Setup instructions: Can a new developer get running from the docs alone? Identify missing steps
6. Examples: Are there usage examples? Generate examples for undocumented features
7. Changelog/history: Is change history maintained? Identify gaps
8. Search/navigation: Can someone find what they need? Suggest structural improvements

Produce a prioritized action plan: Critical (blocks new developer onboarding), Important (causes regular confusion), Nice-to-have (polish). Estimate effort for each item.
