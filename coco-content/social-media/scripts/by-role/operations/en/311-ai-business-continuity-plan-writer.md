# #311 - AI Business Continuity Plan Writer — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Operations / Documentation
**Metric**: 6–12 months to build a BCP → 6–8 weeks with COCO

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: A server rack goes dark. Phones start ringing. The operations manager opens a shared drive and finds a BCP document last updated in 2021.
[Voiceover]: "Your business just went down. Your continuity plan is three years out of date. What now?"

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Timeline showing crisis escalation — 1 hour: confusion. 24 hours: customer escalations. 72 hours: regulatory notification missed. 1 week: $5M in losses. Operations team scrambling without clear procedures.
[Voiceover]: "Business disruptions cost $1.4 million per day on average. Organizations without tested BCPs take 50% longer to recover. Most BCPs are compliance documents, not operational plans — and you find out the difference during the crisis."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: Operations manager working with COCO to conduct a Business Impact Analysis, build a scenario library, draft recovery procedures for a cyber incident, and create a communication template library. Each output appears structured and ready to use.
[Voiceover]: "COCO walks you through the full BCP methodology — business impact analysis, recovery procedures for each scenario, pre-written communication templates, and tabletop exercise designs. Build a real, tested BCP in weeks, not months."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: Tabletop exercise in progress, team confidently executing recovery procedures, auditor approving documentation, operations returning to normal within target timeframes.
[Voiceover]: "Recover 50% faster. Pass audits with confidence. Know exactly what to do when things go wrong — build your BCP at coco.xyz"
