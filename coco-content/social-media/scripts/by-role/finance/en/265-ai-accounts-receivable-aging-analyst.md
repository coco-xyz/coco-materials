**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: AR team staring at a flat aging report — sorted oldest to newest — with no prioritization. A manager circling random invoices to call.
[Voiceover]: "Your AR aging report shows what you're owed. It doesn't tell you who to call, in what order, or which invoices you'll never collect."

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Clock ticking as invoice ages from 60 to 90 to 120 days. Collection probability bar chart dropping — 72%... 52%... 34%... 18%.
[Voiceover]: "An invoice that's 120 days past due has a 34% chance of collection. Over 180 days: 18%. But most AR teams work a flat list — calling the biggest invoice first, not the most collectible one."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: AR analyst inputs aging data into COCO. COCO segments customers into behavioral categories, calculates probability-weighted recovery value, and outputs a ranked collection priority list with specific recommended actions per account.
[Voiceover]: "COCO segments your AR by customer payment behavior — who always pays late but pays, who's showing distress signals. It calculates the real collectible value of your AR and tells you exactly who to contact, how, and in what order."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: AR team working from a COCO priority list. DSO graph trending down. CFO reviewing improved cash flow forecast.
[Voiceover]: "DSO down 9 days. Bad debt write-offs down 30%. $700K cash released. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
