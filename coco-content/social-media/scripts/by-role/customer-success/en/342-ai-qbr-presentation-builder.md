# #342 — AI QBR Presentation Builder — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Customer Success / Reporting
**Metric**: QBR prep time 4–8 hours → 45 minutes; executive attendance 34% → 71%

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: CSM frantically updating a slide deck at 11 PM, screengrabbing usage dashboards, the QBR is in 9 hours
[Voiceover]: "Another QBR tomorrow. Another 5 hours of prep. And your exec sponsor probably won't show up anyway."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Executive in a QBR looking bored, slides full of feature usage numbers, no connection to business outcomes
[Voiceover]: "A data dump QBR drives executive no-shows. When the exec stops attending, the renewal goes to procurement — and you're negotiating on price, not value. 39% of QBRs are skipped entirely due to prep time pressure."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: CSM feeds raw metrics into COCO, a narrative QBR deck appears — executive summary, business outcomes in plain language, strategic recommendations, talking points
[Voiceover]: "Give COCO your raw usage data and onboarding goals. Get a full QBR narrative in 45 minutes — business outcomes, discovery questions, exec summary email, and talking points already written."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: Executive engaged at QBR, nodding, the renewal conversation is being scheduled on the spot
[Voiceover]: "Executive attendance up to 71%. Renewal rate 89% for accounts with quality QBRs. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
