**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: A researcher confidently submitting a survey, then receiving journal rejection stamped with "methodological flaws"
[Voiceover]: "67% of published surveys contain significant methodological flaws. Yours might be one of them."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Split screen showing common survey mistakes — double-barreled questions highlighted in red, biased scale anchors, questions that prime later responses
[Voiceover]: "Double-barreled questions. Leading language. Scales that inflate effect sizes by 26%. These errors are invisible to the untrained eye but fatal in peer review — and even more expensive when a $14M product decision gets made on flawed data."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: Researcher pastes survey into COCO; a structured audit report appears flagging 8 issues with specific corrections; sample size calculation generates instantly; analysis plan appears post-collection
[Voiceover]: "COCO audits every question for bias, calculates your exact sample size, analyzes pilot test results, and guides you through statistical interpretation — from design to publication-ready analysis."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: Clean, validated survey instrument; acceptance notification from journal; confident researcher presenting findings
[Voiceover]: "31% fewer missed responses. 45% fewer analysis errors. Survey research done right — Try COCO at coco.xyz"
