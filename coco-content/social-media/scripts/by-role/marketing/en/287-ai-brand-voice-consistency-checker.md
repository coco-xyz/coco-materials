# #287 - AI Brand Voice Consistency Checker — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Marketing / Brand Management
**Metric**: 58% voice alignment on first drafts → 84% on published content

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: Four different pieces of content side by side — website in formal tone, email in casual tone, LinkedIn in corporate-speak, ad in slang. All supposedly the same brand.
[Voiceover]: "Your brand sounds like four different companies. Your audience can tell."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: 40-page brand guidelines PDF. "Last modified: 2 years ago." Zero downloads. Writers creating content without checking.
[Voiceover]: "Brand guidelines exist in a PDF nobody reads. Content gets distributed across writers, agencies, and freelancers — each with their own voice instincts. The result: your brand is inconsistent across every channel, and it's costing you trust, recognition, and conversions."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: Content submitted to COCO. Instant analysis: voice alignment score 71%, specific sentences flagged, on-brand rewrites suggested. Writer making targeted edits.
[Voiceover]: "COCO analyzes any content against your brand voice model — scoring alignment, flagging specific off-brand sentences, and suggesting exact rewrites. Not 'this is wrong.' Here's what it should say instead."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: Before/after content comparison. Brand voice alignment scores rising across all channels. Published content looking and sounding coherent.
[Voiceover]: "84% voice alignment across all content. 40% fewer voice errors per piece. A brand that sounds like one company. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
