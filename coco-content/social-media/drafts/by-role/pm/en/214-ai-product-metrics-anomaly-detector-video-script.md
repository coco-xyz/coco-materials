# Video Script: AI Product Metrics Anomaly Detector
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "Activation rate has been quietly declining for 11 days. Nobody noticed until the weekly review. By then, three days of data have accumulated, engineering is being pulled from sprint work, and leadership wants a root cause analysis by end of day. You found out about it from your CEO — on Monday morning."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows metrics spread across Mixpanel, Amplitude, Stripe, and Snowflake with no one watching, right side shows a segment-level churn crisis invisible in aggregate data. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "PMs monitor ~5 metrics actively. Naive threshold alerting has a 35-40% false positive rate — conditioning teams to ignore alerts. Subtle changes like a 5% activation decline spread over 10 days are essentially invisible without statistical analysis."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Baseline pattern learning accounting for day-of-week seasonality, holiday patterns, and business cycles to distinguish real signals from noise
  - Segment-level anomaly detection flagging when aggregate metrics look fine but a specific cohort, channel, or plan tier is deteriorating significantly
  - Root cause hypothesis generation cross-referencing recent deploys, campaigns, and infrastructure events against anomaly timing — ranked by probability
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Product Metrics Anomaly Detector reduces mean time to detection from 2-3 days to under 4 hours — with a false positive rate below 8%. Monitor 20+ KPIs automatically, not just the 5 you have time to watch."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "65% of significant anomalies caught before customer impact or external reports. Engineering investigation time per incident cut 40% through pre-generated root cause hypotheses. Teams report 2-3 incidents per quarter where early detection prevented full-scale outages."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
