## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Your Job Postings Are Repelling the Talent You Need**

Recruitment marketing is the front door of your employer brand, and for most companies, that door is rusted shut. The average job posting gets 250 applications — but 88% of them are unqualified. That's not a sourcing success; it's a filtering disaster. Your postings are attracting the wrong people while failing to compel the right ones.

The root cause is content. Most job descriptions are written by committee — a hiring manager drafts requirements, legal adds disclaimers, HR formats it into a template — and the result reads like a government procurement document. "Must have 7+ years of experience in enterprise software with proven track record of driving cross-functional initiatives..." Nobody has ever been inspired to apply by that sentence. Meanwhile, top talent — the people you actually want — apply to only 2-3 companies. They don't need to spray and pray. They choose carefully, and they choose based on employer brand, not job requirements.

Employer branding content is where most companies fall off a cliff. Creating compelling content about your company culture, values, employee stories, and work environment takes 40+ hours per month of dedicated effort. That's a full-time job that most HR teams don't have headcount for. So careers pages languish with stock photos, generic value statements, and job listings that could belong to any company in any industry.

Career page conversion is the clearest evidence of the problem. The industry average is 8% — meaning 92% of people who visit your careers page leave without applying. For context, e-commerce sites average 2-3% conversion, and they're selling products, not asking people to upend their lives for a career change. An 8% conversion rate for something as high-intent as a career page means the page is actively failing.

The cost compounds at every level. The average cost-per-hire is $4,700, but the cost-per-qualified-applicant can be 10x that when you factor in recruiter time spent screening unqualified applications. Companies spend $5,000-$15,000 per job posting on job board fees, sponsored listings, and social media ads — with no guarantee that the right candidates will ever see it.

Social recruitment — posting on LinkedIn, Twitter, and niche communities — is theoretically free but operationally expensive. Crafting authentic, engaging recruitment content for social media requires understanding the platform's culture, the target audience's language, and the company's authentic voice. Most companies either don't do it or do it so poorly that it hurts more than helps.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Recruitment Marketing Writer transforms your employer brand content from a bottleneck into a competitive advantage:

1. **Job Ad Optimization**: COCO rewrites your job descriptions to be compelling, inclusive, and conversion-optimized. It replaces jargon with clear language, highlights what candidates care about (growth, impact, culture, compensation transparency), removes bias-inducing language (research shows words like "ninja" and "rockstar" reduce female applicants by 30%), and A/B tests variations for the highest application rate.

2. **Career Page Content**: COCO generates and refreshes career page content — team descriptions, benefit explanations, culture narratives, and FAQ sections — based on your company's actual culture signals (Glassdoor reviews, employee surveys, social media presence). Content is authentic because it's derived from real data, not marketing wishful thinking.

3. **Social Recruitment Campaigns**: COCO creates platform-native content for LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and niche communities. It generates a content calendar of employer brand posts: employee spotlights, behind-the-scenes content, thought leadership from hiring managers, and milestone celebrations. Each piece is adapted to the platform's format and audience expectations.

4. **Employee Story Generation**: COCO interviews employees (via structured questionnaire or existing survey data) and transforms their responses into compelling narrative content — blog posts, video scripts, social media quotes, and testimonial cards. It identifies the most impactful stories and frames them to resonate with target candidate personas.

5. **Talent Community Nurturing**: For passive candidates who aren't ready to apply, COCO generates email nurture sequences that keep your employer brand top-of-mind. Content includes industry insights, company news, team accomplishments, and upcoming opportunities — providing value before asking for an application.

6. **Conversion Analytics**: COCO tracks every piece of recruitment content's performance — views, clicks, applications, and eventually hires — and uses this data to continuously optimize. It identifies which messages resonate with different candidate segments and adjusts content strategy accordingly.

## Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Job Description Optimizer**
```
Rewrite this job description to maximize qualified applications and minimize unqualified ones:

Current job description:
[paste the full job posting]

Additional context:
- Company: [name, size, industry, stage]
- Team culture: [describe the actual day-to-day culture, not aspirational values]
- Compensation: [range, if sharing]
- Must-have vs. nice-to-have: [clarify which requirements are truly mandatory]
- Target candidate persona: [describe the ideal candidate's background, motivations, and career stage]
- Unique selling points: [what makes this role/company special that competitors can't match?]

Optimize for:
1. Opening Hook: First 2-3 sentences that capture attention and convey the role's impact (not the company's history)
2. Role Description: What the person will actually do in the first 30/60/90 days (not a list of responsibilities)
3. Requirements: Separate genuine must-haves from nice-to-haves. Use inclusive language (replace "X years of experience" with skill-based requirements where possible)
4. Culture & Benefits: Specific, concrete details (not "competitive salary" and "great culture")
5. Bias Check: Flag and replace gendered language, age-biased language, or unnecessarily exclusionary requirements
6. SEO Optimization: Include keywords that target candidates actually search for
7. CTA: Clear, compelling call-to-action that reduces application friction

Output both a full-length version (for career page) and a shortened version (for job boards with character limits).
```

**Prompt 2: Employer Brand Content Calendar**
```
Create a 30-day employer brand content calendar for our social media channels:

Company: [name]
Industry: [industry]
Open roles: [list current openings]
Target candidate personas: [describe 2-3 key personas]
Platforms: [LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram, other]
Brand voice: [describe tone — professional, casual, playful, authoritative, etc.]
Existing assets: [employee photos, office videos, blog posts, awards, etc.]

Generate 30 days of content including:
1. Employee Spotlights (4-5 posts): Interview-style posts highlighting team members, their journey, and what they value about working here. Include questions to ask and suggested format per platform
2. Behind-the-Scenes (4-5 posts): Day-in-the-life content, workspace tours, team rituals, meeting culture
3. Thought Leadership (3-4 posts): Hiring manager or exec insights on industry trends, framed to attract talent who care about those topics
4. Open Role Highlights (4-5 posts): Creative ways to promote specific openings beyond "We're hiring!"
5. Culture & Values (3-4 posts): Real examples of company values in action, not generic statements
6. Milestones & Wins (2-3 posts): Company achievements, team celebrations, product launches framed through the team's perspective
7. Community & Learning (3-4 posts): Volunteering, learning programs, conferences attended, knowledge sharing

For each post provide: platform, format (text/image/video/carousel), copy, visual direction, hashtags, and optimal posting time. Include engagement prompts (questions, polls) to boost interaction.
```

**Prompt 3: Employee Story Content Generator**
```
Transform this employee interview data into multi-format recruitment marketing content:

Employee: [name, role, tenure]
Interview responses:
[paste interview transcript, survey responses, or key quotes]

Company context:
- Open roles on this team: [list]
- Target candidate for this team: [persona description]
- Key messages we want to convey: [2-3 themes]

Generate the following content pieces:
1. Blog Post (800-1000 words): Narrative-style employee story with a compelling arc (challenge → growth → impact). Include pull quotes suitable for social sharing
2. LinkedIn Post (150-200 words): First-person narrative adapted from the story, optimized for LinkedIn engagement patterns
3. Instagram Story Series: 5-7 slides with quotes, facts, and visuals direction for an Instagram story feature
4. Video Script (60-90 seconds): Script for a short recruitment video featuring this employee. Include B-roll suggestions
5. Testimonial Cards: 3 standalone quote cards with different messages, each suitable for use in job postings, career page, or social media
6. Email Snippet: 2-3 sentences suitable for inclusion in talent nurture emails that link to the full story

Ensure all content feels authentic (not corporate-speak), highlights specific details (not generic praise), and subtly connects to the open roles without being a hard sell.
```

**Prompt 4: Career Page Audit and Rewrite**
```
Audit our career page and provide a complete content rewrite:

Current career page: [paste content or describe structure and messaging]
Company: [name, size, industry]
Number of open roles: [count]
Current conversion rate: [if known]
Glassdoor rating: [if known]
Key competitors for talent: [who are candidates also considering?]

Audit against:
1. First Impression: Does the page immediately communicate why someone should work here? Score 1-10
2. Authenticity: Is the content genuine or does it read like marketing copy? Flag corporate-speak
3. Specificity: Are benefits and culture descriptions specific enough to differentiate from competitors?
4. Inclusivity: Does the page welcome diverse candidates? Check language, imagery suggestions, and accessibility
5. Information Architecture: Can candidates find what they need quickly? Role search, team browsing, benefit details
6. Social Proof: Are there employee stories, ratings, awards, or other credibility signals?
7. Conversion Path: How many clicks from landing to application? Where are friction points?

Rewrite providing:
- Hero section (headline + subtext + CTA)
- "Why Join Us" section with 4-5 specific, differentiated value props
- Team/department descriptions (not org chart — what it's like to work on each team)
- Benefits section (organized by what candidates actually care about, not by HR category)
- Employee stories section framework
- FAQ section (address the questions candidates are actually Googling about you)
- Application CTA strategy (different for active vs. passive candidates)
```

**Prompt 5: Recruitment Campaign Performance Analysis**

Campaign data:
[paste metrics — channel, content type, impressions, clicks, applications, qualified applications, hires, spend]

Time period: [dates]

3. Content Performance: Which content types (employee stories, job posts, culture content, thought leadership) drive the most qualified applications?

5. Candidate Quality: For applications from each channel/campaign, what percentage met minimum qualifications? What percentage reached final interview stage?
6. Time-to-Fill Impact: Did any campaigns measurably reduce time-to-fill for specific roles?
