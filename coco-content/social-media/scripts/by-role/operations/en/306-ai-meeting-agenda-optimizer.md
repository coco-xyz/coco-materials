# #306 - AI Meeting Agenda Optimizer — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Operations / Scheduling
**Metric**: 57% of work hours in meetings → 30–40% reduction in meeting duration

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: Operations manager staring at a calendar packed wall-to-wall with back-to-back meetings, visibly exhausted, a stack of unread follow-up emails piling up on screen.
[Voiceover]: "Your calendar is full. Your work isn't getting done. Sound familiar?"

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Split screen — one side shows a vague bullet-point agenda ("Q3 update, misc topics, AOB"), the other shows a meeting running 20 minutes over time with people talking past each other and no clear resolution.
[Voiceover]: "The average enterprise spends over $2 million a year on unproductive meetings. Bad agendas don't just waste time — they delay decisions, erode trust, and create more meetings to fix the ones that failed."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: User types meeting purpose, attendee roles, and time slot into COCO. A structured agenda appears with time-boxed sections, Decision/Discussion/Information labels, pre-read prompts, and a facilitator script.
[Voiceover]: "Tell COCO your meeting goal, who's attending, and how long you have. COCO builds a structured agenda in seconds — with time boxes, clear decision points, pre-read tasks for each role, and a facilitator script to keep everything on track."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: Meeting ends on time, action items are clearly assigned on screen, the operations manager sends a clean summary in under 5 minutes.
[Voiceover]: "30% shorter meetings, clearer decisions, zero ambiguity. Run better meetings starting today — try COCO at coco.xyz"
