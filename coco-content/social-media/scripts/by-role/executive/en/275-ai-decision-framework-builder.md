**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: Executive in a meeting, everyone looking at them expectantly. They nod. Cut to: six months later, same executive reviewing a project that went wrong.
[Voiceover]: "60% of executives say their most regretted decision was made too fast, without enough analysis. Sound familiar?"

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Fast-paced decision scene — whiteboard, sticky notes, pressure. Cognitive bias names flash briefly: Confirmation Bias. Sunk Cost. Planning Fallacy.
[Voiceover]: "You're not making bad decisions because you're a bad thinker. You're making them because cognitive biases hit hardest under time pressure — and most executives never learned a structured decision process."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: Executive typing a major decision into COCO. COCO generates: option set with non-obvious alternatives, assumption map, pre-mortem, bias audit, decision memo.
[Voiceover]: "Tell COCO the decision you're facing. It generates 6 options including ones you haven't considered, identifies your key assumptions, runs a pre-mortem on your instinct, checks for bias — and documents the full reasoning."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: Executive presenting a decision confidently to board members, who nod approvingly. Clean decision memo on screen.
[Voiceover]: "Better decisions, documented reasoning, 41% fewer regrets. — Try COCO at coco.xyz"
