# Use Case #067: AI Tech Debt Tracker

**Role**: Engineering Manager / CTO / Principal Engineer | **Industry**: Technology, SaaS, Enterprise | **Task**: Analysis

## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Tech debt is invisible until it paralyzes velocity; teams can't quantify what to fix first**

Tech debt is invisible until it paralyzes velocity; teams can't quantify what to fix first. This isn't just an inconvenience — it's a measurable drag on the business. Teams that face this challenge report spending an average of 15-30 hours per week on manual workarounds that could be automated.

The real cost goes beyond the immediate time waste. When engineering managers are stuck in reactive mode, strategic work doesn't happen. Opportunities are missed. Competitors who have solved this problem move faster, ship sooner, and serve customers better.

Most teams have tried to address this with a combination of spreadsheets, manual processes, and good intentions. The problem is that these approaches don't scale. What works for 10 items breaks at 100. What works for 100 collapses at 1,000. And in today's environment, you're dealing with thousands.

**How COCO Solves It**

1. **Scans codebase for complexity,**: Scans codebase for complexity, duplication, and coupling hotspots. COCO handles this end-to-end, requiring minimal configuration and zero ongoing maintenance. The system learns from your specific patterns and improves over time.

2. **Quantifies tech debt in**: Quantifies tech debt in engineering hours and business impact. COCO handles this end-to-end, requiring minimal configuration and zero ongoing maintenance. The system learns from your specific patterns and improves over time.

3. **Prioritizes payoff: which debt**: Prioritizes payoff: which debt to fix for maximum velocity gain. COCO handles this end-to-end, requiring minimal configuration and zero ongoing maintenance. The system learns from your specific patterns and improves over time.

**Measurable Results**

- **Debt Visibility**: 15% → 100%
- **Feature Velocity**: +65%
- **Bug Rate**: 12/sprint → 4/sprint
- **Team satisfaction**: Significant improvement reported
- **Time to value**: Results visible within first week
- **ROI payback**: Typically under 30 days

**Who Benefits**

- **Engineering Manager**: Direct time savings and improved outcomes from automated analysis
- **CTO**: Direct time savings and improved outcomes from automated analysis
- **Principal Engineer**: Direct time savings and improved outcomes from automated analysis
- **Leadership**: Better visibility, faster decisions, and measurable ROI
