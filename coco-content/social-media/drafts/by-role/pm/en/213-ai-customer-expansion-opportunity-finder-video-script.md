# Video Script: AI Customer Expansion Opportunity Finder
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "A customer team has been at 90% seat utilization for six weeks. They need more seats. They haven't told anyone. Another account is using three manual workarounds that your Module B would eliminate — the cross-sell writes itself. These signals are already in your data. Nobody's reading them."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows expansion conversations happening only at renewal — the worst possible timing, right side shows $1M in invisible pipeline buried in product analytics. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "Most CS teams wait for customers to ask about expansion — which happens at renewal, when the motion feels transactional. For a $10M ARR business, a 10% improvement in expansion signal identification equals $1M in pipeline that existed but was invisible."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Usage pattern opportunity detection identifying seat utilization thresholds, module gap usage, and power user concentration patterns that predict expansion readiness
  - Health-signal timing engine outputting recommended outreach timing per account — now, 30 days, 90 days, or hold — with green/yellow/red health flags
  - Personalized expansion narrative generation giving CSMs a customer-specific opener using that account's own data, connected to their stated business goals
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Customer Expansion Opportunity Finder surfaces 35-45% more expansion pipeline before the renewal window — with each opportunity timed to positive health signals, not desperation."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "Average expansion deal cycle cut from 90+ days to 30-45 days. Expansion win rate improves 20-30% when timed to positive signals. Average ARR per account increases 18% in year one of signal-based expansion programs — from relationships you already own."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
