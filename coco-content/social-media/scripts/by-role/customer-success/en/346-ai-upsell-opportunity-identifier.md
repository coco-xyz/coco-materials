**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: CSM scrolling through 45 accounts, no clear indication of who is ready to expand, wondering where to start
[Voiceover]: "You have 45 accounts. Which ones are ready to expand? And what should you pitch?"

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: A customer account hitting seat limits, using workarounds, requesting features that exist in the next tier — CSM has no visibility
[Voiceover]: "40 to 60% of expansion revenue is left on the table because CS teams don't have a systematic way to spot buying signals in their accounts. By the time you see them, the customer has already started looking elsewhere."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: CSM pastes account portfolio data, COCO surfaces top 10 expansion opportunities ranked by readiness, each with product fit evidence and a conversation opener
[Voiceover]: "Paste your account data into COCO. Get a ranked list of expansion-ready accounts with the specific evidence, the right product to pitch, and how to open the conversation naturally."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: CSM closing an upsell with a confident, customer-first conversation; NRR dashboard climbing past 120%
[Voiceover]: "Expansion conversion up to 41%. NRR from 109% to 124%. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
