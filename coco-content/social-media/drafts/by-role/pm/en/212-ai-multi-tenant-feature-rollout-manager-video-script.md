# Video Script: AI Multi-Tenant Feature Rollout Manager
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "Rolling out to enterprise tenants isn't a deployment problem — it's a risk management problem. 'Enable for 10% of tenants' sounds controlled. But that 10% might include your anchor customer's most complex integration, or the account whose CTO just called about renewal. Enterprise tenants are not interchangeable."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows a generic feature flag rollout hitting a high-risk enterprise tenant, right side shows simultaneous SLA escalations from 20 enterprise customers. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "~15% of major releases trigger SLA violations under unstructured rollout approaches. Manual per-tenant communication prep takes 45 minutes per tenant. A single bad rollout to your top 20 accounts can generate 20 simultaneous support escalations."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Tenant risk profile scoring classifying each tenant by integration complexity, SLA sensitivity, and strategic account status before a single deployment happens
  - Wave sequencing engine building staged rollout plans that isolate risk — internal first, low-risk second, strategic accounts last with individual pre-rollout reviews
  - Per-tenant rollout communication generator producing accurate, configuration-specific notices — not generic change alerts — in 5 minutes per tenant
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Multi-Tenant Feature Rollout Manager cuts rollout-related support escalations by 60% and SLA violations from ~15% of major releases to under 4%."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "Rollback events down 40% through pre-rollout readiness checks. Per-tenant communication time drops from 45 minutes to 5. Tenant health scores improve 18% vs. unstructured rollout approaches — and your enterprise customers finally get notices that accurately describe their own environment."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
