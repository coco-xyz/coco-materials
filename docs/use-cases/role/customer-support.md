# Use Case #021: AI Ticket Classifier

**Role**: Support Operations / Support Manager / Customer Success | **Industry**: SaaS, E-commerce, Fintech, Healthcare, Telecommunications | **Task**: Ticket Routing, Priority Classification, Auto-Triage, SLA Management

---
## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Manual Ticket Triage Is a Bottleneck That Gets Worse at Scale**

Every support organization faces the triage bottleneck. Incoming tickets arrive through multiple channels (email, chat, web forms, social media, phone) in unstructured natural language. Someone has to read each one, understand the issue, assign a priority, categorize it, and route it to the right team. At 100 tickets/day, a skilled support lead can handle this. At 500/day, it becomes a full-time job. At 1,000+/day, it's impossible for one person and you're hiring triage-only headcount.

The human cost of misrouting is significant. When a ticket goes to the wrong team, the customer waits while it's reassigned. Average reassignment adds 2-4 hours to resolution time. And the customer has to re-explain their issue to a new agent, creating frustration. In high-volume environments, misrouting rates of 20-40% are common.

Priority assignment is equally problematic. A customer reporting a production outage and a customer asking about a feature request both arrive as "new tickets." Without intelligent prioritization, they wait in the same queue, and SLA breaches become inevitable.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Ticket Classifier provides instant, accurate triage for every incoming support ticket.

1. **Natural Language Understanding**: COCO reads the full ticket content and understands:
   - The type of issue (bug, feature request, billing, how-to, account access, integration, etc.)
   - The severity (production down, degraded performance, inconvenience, question)
   - The product area affected
   - The customer's emotional state (frustrated, confused, angry, neutral)
   - Whether the ticket contains enough information to diagnose (or needs clarification)

2. **Multi-Factor Priority Assignment**: Priority isn't just about what the customer says -- it's about context:
   - **Issue severity**: Production outage = P1, Feature request = P4
   - **Customer tier**: Enterprise/VIP customer = priority boost
   - **Business impact**: Revenue-affecting issues get higher priority
   - **Sentiment analysis**: Frustrated/angry customers get elevated attention
   - **SLA context**: Tickets approaching SLA breach get auto-escalated
   - **Repeat tickets**: Same customer, same issue = escalation

3. **Intelligent Routing**: Based on classification, COCO routes to the correct team:
   - Maps issues to specialized teams (billing, technical, product, security)
   - Considers agent availability, workload, and expertise
   - Routes complex issues to senior agents directly
   - Handles multi-issue tickets by splitting or routing to primary team with secondary tag

4. **Auto-Response for Common Issues**: For tickets that match known solutions, COCO:
   - Identifies relevant knowledge base articles
   - Generates a helpful auto-response with the specific solution steps
   - Sets ticket to "Awaiting Customer Confirmation" instead of closing
   - If the customer replies saying it didn't work, auto-escalates to human agent

5. **Escalation Intelligence**: COCO detects escalation triggers:
   - Customer mentions "cancel," "legal," "regulator," or "executive"
   - Customer has submitted 3+ tickets on the same issue
   - SLA breach is imminent
   - VIP customer with any P2+ issue
   - Negative sentiment exceeding threshold

6. **Continuous Learning**: Classification accuracy improves over time:
   - Learns from agent corrections (when an agent reclassifies a ticket)
   - Adapts to new issue types as products evolve
   - Updates routing rules based on resolution patterns

**Measurable Results**

- **Misrouting rate**: From 31% to 4% (87% reduction)
- **First-response time**: From 4.7 hours to 47 minutes (83% reduction)
- **Auto-resolved tickets**: 35% of volume handled without human agent
- **CSAT score**: From 72% to 89%
- **Triage labor saved**: 3+ hours/day of team lead time
- **SLA breach rate**: From 18% to 3%
- **Average resolution time**: Reduced by 42%

**Who Benefits**

- **Support Agents**: Receive properly categorized, prioritized tickets in their specialty area
- **Support Managers**: Eliminate triage bottleneck; focus on quality and coaching
- **Customers**: Faster, more accurate first responses; fewer "wrong department" bounces
- **Operations**: Clean ticket data for reporting, capacity planning, and product feedback loops

## Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Build Ticket Classification Taxonomy**
```
Help me build a ticket classification taxonomy for our support team.

Our product: [describe your product]
Support channels: [email, chat, phone, web form]
Current team structure: [list specialist teams, e.g., billing, technical, product]
Common issue types we see: [list the types of issues you get most often]
SLA tiers: [list your SLA requirements by priority level]

Create:
1. Category taxonomy (3 levels: Category > Subcategory > Issue Type) with at least 30 issue types
2. Priority matrix mapping issue types to priority levels (P1-P4)
3. Routing rules: which team handles which categories
4. Auto-escalation triggers: conditions that should automatically escalate a ticket
5. Auto-response candidates: issue types where a KB article can fully resolve the question
6. Sentiment-based overrides: when sentiment should change priority regardless of issue type
```

**Prompt 2: Classify a Batch of Tickets**
```
Classify these support tickets. For each, provide: category, subcategory, priority (P1-P4), recommended team, sentiment score, and whether it can be auto-resolved with a KB article.

Our classification taxonomy:
[paste your taxonomy or describe categories]

Our priority definitions:
- P1: Production down, security breach, data loss
- P2: Major feature broken, significant business impact
- P3: Minor issue, workaround available
- P4: Question, feature request, minor cosmetic issue

Tickets:

Ticket #1: "[paste ticket subject and body]"
Ticket #2: "[paste ticket subject and body]"
Ticket #3: "[paste ticket subject and body]"
[...continue]

For each ticket, output:
| Ticket | Category | Subcategory | Priority | Team | Sentiment | Auto-resolve? | Reasoning |
```

**Prompt 3: Write Auto-Response Templates**
```
Create auto-response templates for our top 10 most common ticket types. Each response should feel helpful and human, not robotic.

Our top 10 ticket types:
1. [Issue type] - [brief description of what customers ask]
2. [Issue type] - [brief description]
[...continue for all 10]

Our brand voice: [describe - e.g., "friendly, professional, empathetic"]
Our product name: [name]

For each ticket type, write:
1. An empathetic opening (acknowledges their issue)
2. Step-by-step solution (clear, numbered steps)
3. Link placeholder for relevant KB article: [KB: article-name]
4. Fallback: "If this doesn't resolve your issue, reply to this email and a team member will assist you within [SLA timeframe]"
5. Warm sign-off

Keep each response under 150 words. Test readability: would a frustrated customer find this helpful, not annoying?

# Use Case #022: AI Knowledge Base Builder

**Role**: Support Lead / Technical Writer / Knowledge Manager | **Industry**: SaaS, Technology, E-commerce, Any Company with Customer Support | **Task**: Knowledge Base Creation, Article Writing, Content Gap Analysis, Self-Service Optimization

---
## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Knowledge Bases That Don't Actually Help Anyone**

Most companies have a knowledge base. Few have an effective one. The gap between "having a KB" and "having a KB that actually deflects tickets" is enormous, and it's measured in content quality, coverage, freshness, and searchability.

The content debt problem is universal. Products evolve faster than documentation teams can keep up. Features get renamed, workflows change, new integrations launch -- and the KB articles that describe the old behavior become actively harmful, sending customers down wrong paths and generating more support tickets than they prevent.

The economics of KB maintenance are challenging. Writing a comprehensive, clear, screenshot-rich help article takes 2-3 hours for an experienced technical writer. Maintaining it (reviewing for accuracy, updating screenshots, adding new steps) takes another 1-2 hours per year per article. At 500 articles, that's 500-1,000 hours of annual maintenance alone -- before writing any new content.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Knowledge Base Builder transforms resolved support tickets into published knowledge base content, keeping the KB comprehensive and current.

1. **Ticket-to-Article Mining**: COCO analyzes your resolved ticket history to:
   - Identify the most frequently asked questions (by volume and by search query)
   - Extract the solutions agents provided for each question
   - Group similar tickets to find the canonical solution
   - Identify questions with no existing KB article

2. **Article Generation**: For each identified gap, COCO generates:
   - Clear, jargon-free title optimized for search
   - Step-by-step instructions with numbered steps
   - Screenshot placeholders with descriptions of what to capture
   - Troubleshooting decision trees for complex issues
   - Related articles and cross-references
   - FAQ format for simple questions

3. **Content Freshness Management**: COCO continuously monitors for content drift:
   - Compares KB articles against current product behavior
   - Flags articles that reference deprecated features, old UI, or changed workflows
   - Generates updated drafts with current information
   - Tracks article age and schedules reviews

4. **Search Optimization**: COCO improves KB discoverability:
   - Adds synonyms and alternative phrasings to articles (so "can't log in" matches "login not working")
   - Generates meta descriptions optimized for internal search
   - Suggests article restructuring based on search analytics
   - Identifies "dead end" searches with no results and creates content for them

5. **Multi-Format Content**: Beyond text articles, COCO creates:
   - Interactive troubleshooting guides (if X, try Y; if that doesn't work, try Z)
   - Quick-start guides for new features
   - Video script outlines for screen recording
   - Chatbot-ready Q&A pairs
   - In-app tooltip content

6. **Effectiveness Analytics**: COCO tracks KB performance:
   - Article views, search hit rates, and self-service resolution rates
   - Articles with high views but low satisfaction (needs rewriting)
   - Search terms with no results (content gaps)
   - Ticket-to-article correlation (which articles actually prevent tickets)

**Measurable Results**

- **KB article coverage**: From 340 (127 outdated) to 520 (all current)
- **Self-service deflection rate**: From 12% to 41%
- **Support ticket volume**: Reduced 29%
- **Article creation time**: From 2-3 hours to 30 minutes (review and publish only)
- **KB freshness**: 100% of articles reviewed within 90-day cycle
- **Search "no results" rate**: From 38% to 8%
- **Customer satisfaction with self-service**: From 2.8/5 to 4.1/5

**Who Benefits**

- **Customers**: Find answers themselves, faster, 24/7
- **Support Agents**: Fewer repetitive tickets; more time for complex issues
- **Technical Writers**: Shift from writer to editor; higher-impact work
- **Support Leaders**: Lower cost per resolution; better CSAT; scalable support

## Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Generate KB Article from Resolved Tickets**
```
Create a customer-facing knowledge base article based on these resolved support tickets about the same issue.

Resolved tickets:
Ticket 1: Customer asked: "[question]" - Agent resolved by: "[solution steps]"
Ticket 2: Customer asked: "[question]" - Agent resolved by: "[solution steps]"
Ticket 3: Customer asked: "[question]" - Agent resolved by: "[solution steps]"

Write a KB article with:
1. Clear, search-friendly title
2. Brief description of when a user would encounter this issue
3. Step-by-step solution (numbered, clear, assume no technical background)
4. [SCREENSHOT: description of what to capture] placeholders where visual guidance would help
5. Troubleshooting section: "If the above steps don't work, try..."
6. Related articles section (suggest 2-3 related topics)

Tone: Friendly and helpful. Write at an 8th-grade reading level. Avoid jargon.
Product name: [your product name]
```

**Prompt 2: KB Content Gap Analysis**
```
Analyze these support ticket categories and identify knowledge base content gaps.

Top 20 ticket categories by volume (last 90 days):
1. [Category] - [X tickets] - KB article exists: [yes/no]
2. [Category] - [X tickets] - KB article exists: [yes/no]
[...continue for all 20]

Top 20 KB search queries with "no results":
1. "[search query]" - [X searches]
2. "[search query]" - [X searches]
[...continue]

Generate:
1. Prioritized list of articles to create (highest ticket deflection potential first)
2. For each needed article: suggested title, outline, and estimated complexity (simple FAQ / step-by-step guide / troubleshooting guide)
3. Existing articles that need updating (based on high volume + existing article)
4. Suggested article consolidation (multiple articles that should be merged)
5. Estimated ticket deflection if these gaps are filled (based on volume data)
```

**Prompt 3: Rewrite Underperforming KB Article**
```
This KB article has high traffic but low satisfaction ratings. Rewrite it to be clearer and more helpful.

Current article:
[paste the current article text]

Performance data:
- Monthly views: [X]
- Helpfulness rating: [X]/5
- Common feedback: [paste customer feedback if available]
- % of viewers who still submit a ticket after viewing: [X]%

Rewrite the article with:
1. Clearer title (what problem does this solve, in the customer's words?)
2. "Before you start" section (prerequisites, what you'll need)
3. Simplified step-by-step instructions (shorter sentences, one action per step)
4. Visual guidance placeholders where steps are complex
5. "Common issues" troubleshooting section
6. Clear success criteria ("You'll know it worked when...")
7. "Still need help?" section with contact options

Compare the original and rewrite, noting specific improvements.

# Use Case #023: AI Multi-Language Support

**Role**: Support Manager / Customer Success / Global Operations | **Industry**: SaaS, E-commerce, Gaming, Fintech, Any Global Company | **Task**: Multi-Language Customer Support, Real-Time Translation, Localized Response Generation

---
## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Global Expansion Requires Support in Languages You Don't Speak**

Going global is one of the most common growth strategies -- and one of the most common support nightmares. When you launch in a new market, customers expect support in their language. Not machine-translated support with awkward grammar and incorrect technical terms. Native-quality support that understands cultural norms and communication expectations.

The traditional approach -- hiring native-speaking agents for each market -- doesn't scale. Recruiting bilingual support agents who also have product knowledge takes months. Supporting 10+ languages requires 10+ dedicated agents (at minimum), creating significant fixed costs before the new market generates revenue. And during off-hours, those markets have no coverage.

Machine translation tools (Google Translate, DeepL) solve the language barrier superficially but create a quality problem. Technical terms get mistranslated. Cultural nuances are lost. Tone is wrong. Customers immediately recognize machine-translated responses, and their trust drops accordingly.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Multi-Language Support provides native-quality multilingual customer service without requiring native-speaking agents.

1. **Intelligent Language Detection**: COCO automatically detects the customer's language, even when:
   - The ticket contains multiple languages (common with technical terms)
   - The language uses non-Latin scripts (Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew)
   - The customer writes in a regional dialect or variant
   - Code snippets are mixed in with natural language

2. **Context-Aware Translation for Agents**: Incoming tickets are translated to the agent's language with:
   - Technical terms preserved (don't translate "API endpoint" or product feature names)
   - Cultural context notes (e.g., "This customer is using very formal Japanese, suggesting high-level contact")
   - Sentiment indicators (frustration level, urgency)
   - Original text alongside translation for agents who partially understand the language

3. **Native-Quality Response Generation**: When agents write in their language, COCO translates the response with:
   - **Linguistic fluency**: Natural grammar, idioms, and phrasing -- not word-by-word translation
   - **Cultural adaptation**: Appropriate formality level, honorifics, politeness conventions
   - **Technical accuracy**: Product terms, feature names, and technical concepts correctly localized
   - **Brand voice preservation**: Maintains your support team's tone across languages
   - **Format awareness**: Handles date formats, currency symbols, number conventions per locale

4. **Cultural Intelligence**: COCO adapts communication style per culture:
   - **Japanese**: Appropriate keigo (honorific language) level, indirect communication, apology-first approach
   - **German**: Formal Sie/du distinction, direct communication, precision-oriented
   - **Brazilian Portuguese**: Warm, friendly tone, relationship-oriented, appropriate informality
   - **Korean**: Proper honorific levels, organizational hierarchy awareness
   - **Arabic**: Right-to-left formatting, appropriate greetings, cultural sensitivity

5. **Multilingual Knowledge Base Integration**: COCO can:
   - Search your English KB and return relevant articles translated to the customer's language
   - Generate localized versions of self-service responses
   - Maintain consistent terminology across all languages
   - Flag KB articles that need official localized versions

6. **Quality Assurance**: Translation quality is maintained through:
   - Back-translation verification (translate response, translate back to source, compare)
   - Glossary enforcement (product terms are always translated consistently)
   - Cultural review flags (content that might be culturally inappropriate in the target language)
   - Agent feedback loop (agents who speak the language can rate and correct translations)

**Measurable Results**

- **Languages supported**: 14 languages with consistent quality
- **Markets served**: Scaled from 5 to 23 countries with same team size
- **Multi-language CSAT**: From 61% to 87%
- **Hiring cost avoidance**: Estimated $420K/year in avoided language-specialist hiring
- **Response time for non-English tickets**: From 12+ hours (waiting for specialist) to 45 minutes
- **Translation quality score**: 4.3/5 rated by native speaker auditors

**Who Benefits**

- **Global Customers**: Support in their language, at their quality expectations, 24/7
- **Support Agents**: Handle tickets in any language without language barriers
- **Support Leaders**: Scale global support without proportional headcount per language
- **Business Leaders**: Expand into new markets faster with support readiness from day one

# Use Case #024: AI VIP Escalation

**Role**: Enterprise Support / Customer Success Manager / Support Operations | **Industry**: SaaS, Enterprise Software, Fintech, Healthcare | **Task**: VIP Customer Detection, Intelligent Escalation, Priority Queue Management, Churn Prevention

---
## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Your Support System Can't Tell a $500K Customer from a Free Trial User**

Most support systems treat all customers equally. From a fairness perspective, this seems right. From a business perspective, it's catastrophic. When a $500K enterprise account gets the same 4-hour SLA as a $50/month subscriber, you're making an implicit statement about how much you value that relationship.

Enterprise customers don't just expect faster support -- they expect contextual support. When they contact you, they expect the agent to know their account, their history, their contract terms, and their strategic priorities. Being treated as ticket #4,527 in a faceless queue is, for many enterprise buyers, the beginning of the end.

The churn economics are stark. Losing one enterprise account can equal losing 100+ SMB accounts. And by the time a VP emails your CEO saying "we're evaluating alternatives," the damage is done -- recovery is expensive and uncertain. The support interaction that precipitated that email might have been trivially easy to handle correctly, if only someone had flagged it as important.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI VIP Escalation creates a smart layer that ensures high-value customers receive treatment proportional to their business importance.

1. **Real-Time Customer Value Recognition**: When a ticket arrives, COCO instantly identifies:
   - Account tier (ARR, contract value, strategic importance)
   - Renewal date proximity (accounts within 90 days of renewal get priority boost)
   - Account health score (NPS, product usage, support history)
   - Contact's role (executive contacts get different treatment than end users)
   - Expansion pipeline (accounts with active upsell opportunities)

2. **Intelligent Escalation Matrix**: COCO applies dynamic escalation rules:
   - **Tier 1 (Enterprise VIP)**: P1-P2 issues go directly to senior agent + immediate CSM notification. P3-P4 go to dedicated enterprise queue with 30-minute SLA.
   - **Tier 2 (Growth accounts)**: P1 gets immediate escalation. P2-P4 get priority queue placement.
   - **Renewal Risk**: Any account within 60 days of renewal gets automatic priority boost regardless of issue severity.
   - **Churn Signal Detection**: Language analysis flags tickets containing churn indicators.

3. **Context-Rich Agent Handoff**: When a VIP ticket is escalated, the agent receives:
   - Account summary (ARR, products, contract dates, key stakeholders)
   - Ticket history (recent issues, resolution patterns, satisfaction scores)
   - Relationship context (CSM notes, last executive meeting, known concerns)
   - Renewal/expansion context (upcoming renewal, active opportunities)
   - Recommended approach (based on account health and contact personality)

4. **Churn Signal Detection**: COCO analyzes ticket content for warning signs:
   - Direct signals: "cancel," "downgrade," "not renewing," "looking at alternatives"
   - Indirect signals: "frustrated," "this keeps happening," "not getting value," "executive team is asking"
   - Pattern signals: Increasing ticket frequency, escalating severity, shorter messages (disengagement)
   - Triggers automatic CSM alert with risk assessment

5. **Proactive Intervention**: Beyond reactive escalation, COCO enables:
   - Weekly VIP account health reports for CSMs
   - Automatic outreach triggers when usage drops below threshold
   - Sentiment trend analysis across all touchpoints
   - Early warning system for accounts showing pre-churn patterns

6. **Executive Communication Handling**: When C-level contacts submit tickets:
   - Immediate routing to most senior available agent
   - CSM and account manager notified within 5 minutes
   - Response drafted with executive-appropriate tone and detail level
   - Follow-up scheduled within 24 hours regardless of resolution

**Measurable Results**

- **VIP first-response time**: 12 minutes (vs. 2 hours standard)
- **VIP accounts churned due to support**: 0 (previous year: 4 accounts, $1.2M ARR)
- **VIP CSAT**: 94% (vs. 84% overall)
- **Churn signals detected and saved**: 11 at-risk accounts identified and retained ($2.8M ARR)
- **CSM proactive intervention rate**: From 23% to 78% of VIP issues
- **Enterprise renewal rate**: From 89% to 96%

**Who Benefits**

- **Enterprise Customers**: Feel valued and prioritized; issues resolved faster
- **Support Agents**: Clear priority guidance; pre-loaded context for VIP interactions
- **Customer Success Managers**: Early warning on at-risk accounts; data for proactive outreach
- **Revenue Leaders**: Protected enterprise revenue; higher renewal rates

---

## Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Build VIP Escalation Rules**
```
Design a VIP escalation framework for our support team.

Our customer tiers:
- Enterprise: $100K+ ARR, [X] accounts
- Mid-Market: $10K-$100K ARR, [X] accounts
- SMB: Under $10K ARR, [X] accounts

Current SLAs:
- P1: [X hours] first response
- P2: [X hours] first response
- P3: [X hours] first response

Design:
1. Escalation matrix: For each customer tier x priority level, define response SLA, agent tier, and notification rules
2. Auto-escalation triggers: Conditions that automatically bump priority
3. Churn signal keywords: Words/phrases that should trigger CSM alerts
4. Executive contact handling: Special rules for C-level contacts
5. Renewal proximity rules: How to adjust priority based on days-to-renewal
6. Metrics to track: KPIs that measure VIP support effectiveness
```

**Prompt 2: Analyze Account Risk from Support Interactions**
```
Analyze these recent support interactions for a key account and assess churn risk.

Account: [Company], $[X] ARR, renewal date: [date]
CSM: [name]
Account health score: [current score]

Recent support tickets (last 90 days):
1. Date: [X] | Issue: [X] | Priority: [X] | Resolution time: [X] | CSAT: [X]
2. Date: [X] | Issue: [X] | Priority: [X] | Resolution time: [X] | CSAT: [X]
[...continue]

Recent support excerpts (customer language):
[paste notable customer messages]

Analyze:
1. Churn risk level (Low/Medium/High/Critical) with reasoning
2. Pattern analysis: Is ticket frequency/severity increasing?
3. Sentiment trend: Is the customer becoming more frustrated over time?
4. Key concerns: What issues keep recurring?
5. Recommended actions for CSM (immediate, this week, this month)
6. Talking points for next CSM check-in call
```

**Prompt 3: Draft VIP Customer Apology and Recovery Email**
```
A VIP customer had a poor support experience. Draft a recovery email from their CSM.

Account: [Company], $[X] ARR
Contact: [Name], [Title]
What happened: [describe the support failure - e.g., long wait time, incorrect resolution, multiple transfers]
Customer's stated frustration: [paste their words if available]
Relationship history: [strong/strained/new]

Write an email that:
1. Acknowledges the specific failure (don't be vague)
2. Takes ownership without excuses
3. Explains what we're doing to fix the root cause (not just this instance)
4. Offers a concrete goodwill gesture appropriate to the relationship tier
5. Provides direct escalation path for future issues
6. Maintains dignity -- apologetic but not groveling

Tone: Senior, professional, genuine. This should sound like it comes from someone who genuinely cares about the relationship, not a PR template.
```
