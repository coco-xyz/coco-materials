Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows frustrated worker, right side shows mounting task list. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "Manual processes drain your team's time and energy. Hours lost every week on tasks that should take minutes."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
