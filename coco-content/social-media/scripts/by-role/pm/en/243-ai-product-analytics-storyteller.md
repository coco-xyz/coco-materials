# #243 - AI Product Analytics Storyteller — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Product Manager / Analysis
**Metric**: Analytics presentations produce decisions 47% more often with narrative vs. dashboards

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: A PM presenting a Mixpanel dashboard in a leadership meeting — executives looking confused, someone saying "so is 43% retention... good?"
[Voiceover]: "Your data is good. Your ability to explain what it means — that's another story."

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: A PM pulling charts from four different tools, then spending three hours writing a "what does this mean?" narrative; executives in a meeting making decisions based on metrics they can't interpret without the PM present
[Voiceover]: "69% of product leaders say their teams can't translate data into actionable insights — despite having better analytics tools than ever. The bottleneck isn't the data. It's the translation. A dashboard doesn't tell you why your retention dropped 4 points, what's causing it, or what to do. A story does."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: COCO transforming a raw metrics table into a structured narrative with causal hypotheses, benchmarked context, and specific recommendations — then showing three audience-specific versions of the same analysis
[Voiceover]: "COCO turns your raw metrics into a complete analytical narrative — with historical context, benchmarked meaning, causal hypotheses ranked by likelihood, and specific recommendations with business impact estimates. One input. Executive version, team version, and investor version — all in minutes."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: An executive meeting where a PM presents a crisp narrative and a decision gets made on the spot
[Voiceover]: "47% more decisions per analytics presentation. 76% of executives actually understand your product performance. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
