# #274 - AI Weekly Review Summarizer — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Executive / Reporting
**Metric**: 87% weekly review completion rate vs. 22% without structure

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: Executive leaving the office Friday evening, phone buzzing, face tired. Text overlay: "Another week gone. Do you know what actually moved?"
[Voiceover]: "Every Friday, you feel like you were busy. But were you busy on the right things?"

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Montage — full calendar, inbox, Slack notifications. Then a whiteboard with quarterly goals, barely touched.
[Voiceover]: "Executives who don't do structured weekly reviews miss 2 stalled priorities per week on average — and only notice them when it's too late. A 90-minute manual review feels impossible, so it doesn't happen. Strategic drift sets in."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: Executive typing a quick summary of their week into COCO — rough notes, bullet points. COCO produces: week summary, priority progress traffic lights, risk flags, top 3 for next week.
[Voiceover]: "Drop your week into COCO — messy notes are fine. In 20 minutes, you get a full picture: what moved, what stalled, what's at risk, and your top three priorities for next week. No synthesis required."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: Executive starting Monday morning reviewing a clean next-week priority card. Calm and focused instead of reactive.
[Voiceover]: "20-minute review. 28% better priority achievement. Start every Monday knowing exactly where to focus. — Try COCO at coco.xyz"
