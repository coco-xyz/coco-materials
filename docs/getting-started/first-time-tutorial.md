# First-Time Tutorial

Welcome to COCO! Your dedicated AI employee has been deployed.

**You don't need any technical skills** — just talk to it like a new colleague and tell it what you need help with.

## 3 Steps to Get Started

1. **Choose a Role** — Tell the AI what job it's responsible for
2. **Describe Your Task** — Hand it whatever you're working on
3. **Review Results** — Refine and iterate if needed

## Step 1: Choose Your AI Employee's Role

Your AI employee can handle many different positions. Choose based on your actual needs (**you can select multiple**):

| Role | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Product / Dev | Write PRDs, code, technical docs | Product managers, developers, tech leads |
| Operations | Data analysis, process optimization, automated reports | Operations managers, COOs, business analysts |
| Finance | Financial analysis, budgeting, cost accounting | Finance staff, CFOs, founders |
| Content / Marketing | Copywriting, social media, SEO, competitive analysis | Marketers, content creators, brand managers |

| Sales | Customer research, sales proposals, follow-up emails | Sales reps, BDs, founders |

> **Tip:** You can select multiple roles! For example, founders often choose "Operations + Content/Marketing + Assistant." The AI employee automatically adjusts its work style based on your selected roles.

### Not sure what to choose?

Just tell the AI your actual problem. For example:
- "I have a pile of customer feedback that I haven't organized"
- "My boss wants a competitive analysis report by next week"
- "We need to hire 3 people and I can't keep up with the resumes"
- "I need to prepare a financial report for investors this month"

The AI will help break down the problem, clarify your needs, and guide you step by step.
