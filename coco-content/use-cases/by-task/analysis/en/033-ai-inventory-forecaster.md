## Social Media Copy

Last Black Friday, we stocked 40,000 units of our best-selling product. We sold out by 2 PM on Saturday. Lost an estimated $280K in sales over the remaining weekend. Meanwhile, we were sitting on $450K of slow-moving inventory from a product line that our demand planner had overestimated by 60%.

Two mistakes, same root cause: our forecasting was based on last year's numbers plus a growth factor plus gut feel. It didn't account for the competitor who went out of stock (driving demand to us), the TikTok video that went viral for one SKU, or the macro shift in consumer preferences away from our overstock category.

Inventory planning with spreadsheets is bringing a knife to a data fight.

COCO's AI Inventory Forecaster replaced gut feel with signal detection:
- Analyzes 36 months of sales data, seasonality patterns, and trend curves per SKU
- Incorporates external signals: competitor stock status, social media mentions, weather forecasts, economic indicators
- Generates demand forecasts at the SKU level with confidence intervals (not just a single number)
- Recommends optimal reorder points and quantities balancing stockout risk vs. carrying cost
- Flags anomalies: "SKU #4721 trending 340% above forecast -- investigate TikTok mention on Jan 12"

Stockout events: down 67%. Overstock write-downs: down 43%. Inventory turnover ratio: improved from 4.2x to 6.1x. Working capital freed up: $1.2M. We don't guess anymore.

## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Inventory Forecasting with Spreadsheets Costs Millions in Stockouts and Overstock**

Inventory management is a balancing act where both sides of the failure are expensive. Stockouts mean lost revenue, disappointed customers, and market share gifted to competitors. Overstock means tied-up working capital, warehousing costs, markdowns, and write-offs. The optimal point between them requires accurate demand forecasting -- and that's where most companies fail.

Traditional forecasting relies on historical sales data adjusted with growth factors and planner intuition. This approach misses demand signals that don't appear in historical data: viral social media moments, competitor stockouts, weather-driven demand shifts, macroeconomic changes, and promotional calendar effects.

The cost of getting it wrong is staggering. IHL Group estimates that global retailers lose $1.75 trillion annually to overstock and out-of-stock situations combined. For a mid-size e-commerce company doing $50M in revenue, forecast errors typically represent $2-5M in lost sales and write-downs. The demand planner using Excel is doing their best with inadequate tools against an increasingly unpredictable market.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Inventory Forecaster combines historical analysis with real-time signal detection for SKU-level demand prediction.

1. **Multi-Variable Demand Modeling**: Goes far beyond "last year + growth factor":
   - Analyzes 24-36 months of sales history per SKU
   - Decomposes time series into trend, seasonality, and cyclical components
   - Accounts for promotions, pricing changes, and product lifecycle stage
   - Models cannibalization effects (new product launches stealing from existing SKUs)
   - Handles new product forecasting using analog products and market data

2. **External Signal Integration**: Incorporates data that spreadsheets can't:
   - Competitor intelligence: competitor pricing changes, stock availability, promotional activity
   - Social media trends: viral mentions, influencer posts, hashtag velocity
   - Weather data: temperature and precipitation forecasts affecting seasonal products
   - Economic indicators: consumer confidence, employment data, inflation trends
   - Industry reports: category growth data, market share shifts
   - Calendar effects: holidays, events, school schedules, cultural observances

3. **Probabilistic Forecasting**: Replaces single-number predictions with risk-aware ranges:
   - Provides demand forecasts with 80% confidence intervals (low / expected / high)
   - Enables risk-weighted inventory decisions (stock to the 80th percentile for critical SKUs, 50th for low-margin)
   - Quantifies forecast uncertainty per SKU (some products are inherently more predictable)
   - Monte Carlo simulation for peak period planning (Black Friday, holiday season)

4. **Reorder Optimization**: Calculates optimal inventory parameters:
   - **Reorder point**: When to place a new order (considering lead time and demand variability)
   - **Reorder quantity**: How much to order (balancing ordering cost vs. carrying cost)
   - **Safety stock**: Buffer inventory needed to achieve target service level
   - **Dynamic adjustment**: Parameters update automatically as demand patterns change
   - **Supplier lead time modeling**: Accounts for variability in supplier delivery times

5. **Anomaly Detection and Early Warning**: Catches demand shifts before they become problems:
   - Real-time sales velocity monitoring against forecast
   - Automatic alerts when actuals deviate significantly from predictions
   - Root cause hypotheses: "SKU #4721 trending 340% above forecast -- possible causes: TikTok mention Jan 12 (145K views), competitor stockout detected Jan 10"
   - Enables rapid response: emergency reorder, substitution planning, demand channeling

6. **What-If Scenarios**: Models the impact of business decisions on inventory needs:
   - "What if we run a 20% off promotion on this category?"
   - "What if Supplier A's lead time increases from 4 weeks to 8 weeks?"
   - "What if we launch Product B -- how does it cannibalize Product A?"
   - "What if we expand to 3 new geographic markets?"
   - Helps leadership make inventory-aware business decisions

**Measurable Results**

- **Stockout reduction**: 67% fewer stockout events
- **Overstock reduction**: 43% lower write-downs
- **Inventory turnover**: From 4.2x to 6.1x
- **Forecast accuracy (MAPE)**: Improved from 32% to 14%
- **Working capital freed**: $1.2M from optimized inventory levels
- **Revenue protected**: $280K+ in prevented lost sales per peak season
- **Planner productivity**: 60% less time on manual forecasting, more time on strategic planning
- **Supply chain responsiveness**: Demand shifts detected 2-3 weeks earlier

**Who Benefits**

- **Demand Planners**: Better tools replace gut feel; focus shifts from spreadsheet maintenance to strategic analysis
- **Supply Chain Managers**: Fewer stockouts and overstocks; smoother operations; better supplier relationships
- **CFO/Finance**: Freed working capital; lower inventory write-downs; better cash flow predictability
- **Sales Teams**: Products in stock when customers want them; fewer "sorry, out of stock" moments
- **Warehouse/Logistics**: More predictable inbound volumes; better space and labor planning
- **Customers**: Better product availability; fewer backorders and cancellations

## Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Generate Demand Forecast**
```
Generate a demand forecast for the next [3/6/12 months] at the SKU level.

Historical sales data (last 24-36 months):
[paste monthly sales by SKU or describe data availability]

Additional context:
- Upcoming promotions: [list planned promotions with dates]
- Price changes: [any planned price adjustments]
- New product launches: [products that might cannibalize or complement]
- Known supply constraints: [any supply chain issues]
- Seasonal events: [Black Friday, back-to-school, holidays, etc.]

For each SKU, provide:
1. Monthly demand forecast with low/mid/high scenarios
2. Confidence interval (80%)
3. Key assumptions
4. Recommended safety stock level
5. Reorder point and quantity
6. Flags for SKUs with high forecast uncertainty
```

**Prompt 2: Inventory Health Audit**
```
Audit our current inventory for optimization opportunities.

Current inventory:
[paste inventory data: SKU, quantity on hand, unit cost, average monthly sales, days of supply]

Analyze and identify:
1. **Overstock** (>90 days supply): Which SKUs have excess? Estimated carrying cost?
2. **Stockout risk** (<14 days supply for high-velocity items): Which SKUs need urgent reorder?
3. **Dead stock** (<1 unit sold in 90 days): Value tied up in non-moving inventory?
4. **ABC classification**: Categorize SKUs by revenue contribution (A=top 80%, B=next 15%, C=bottom 5%)
5. **Reorder priorities**: Ranked list of SKUs to reorder this week
6. **Liquidation candidates**: SKUs to consider discounting or writing off
7. **Working capital opportunity**: How much capital can be freed by optimizing?
```

**Prompt 3: Supply Chain Disruption Scenario Planning**
```
Help me plan for potential supply chain disruptions and their inventory impact.

Current supply chain:
- Key suppliers: [list suppliers, products, lead times, geographic locations]
- Current inventory levels: [by product category or key SKUs]
- Monthly demand: [average monthly sales by category]
- Alternative suppliers: [list any backup suppliers and their capabilities]

Model these scenarios:
1. **Supplier delay**: Primary supplier lead time increases from [X] to [Y] weeks. Impact on stockouts? Recommended safety stock adjustment?
2. **Demand spike**: [Category/SKU] demand increases [X]% due to [reason]. Can current inventory and supply pipeline handle it?
3. **Logistics disruption**: Shipping from [region] delayed by [X] weeks. Which SKUs are most at risk? Alternative sourcing options?
4. **Raw material shortage**: Key component becomes scarce, reducing supplier capacity by [X]%. Allocation strategy?

For each scenario:
- Financial impact (lost sales, expediting costs, carrying costs)
- Recommended preventive actions now
- Trigger points for executing contingency plans
- Communication plan for sales/marketing teams
```
