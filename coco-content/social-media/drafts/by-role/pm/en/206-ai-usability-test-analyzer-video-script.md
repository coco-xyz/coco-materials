# Video Script: AI Usability Test Analyzer
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "Your team ran 80 unmoderated usability sessions. You had time to watch 20 of them. The other 60 are sitting unreviewed while your next sprint starts tomorrow."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows a mountain of unprocessed session recordings, right side shows developers waiting for research findings to start building. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "Manual analysis of 8 sessions takes a full week. Teams cherry-pick what they have bandwidth to watch — introducing selection bias and leaving 70% of behavioral signal unexamined."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Task completion rate analysis across 100% of sessions with friction severity ranking
  - Click path deviation detection identifying exactly where users go off-script
  - Cross-session pattern synthesis separating systemic UX problems from individual outliers
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Usability Test Analyzer processes all session data in 6–8 hours — surfacing 2.5x more friction points than manual review. Ready to use without setup."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "Analysis time drops from 5–7 days to under 8 hours. False positives cut by 40%. Design handoff accelerated from 10 days to under 2 — sprints stop waiting for research."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
