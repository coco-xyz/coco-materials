## Scenario

**Who:** A tech lead at an early-stage startup who needs to quickly validate a product idea.

**Problem:** Building an MVP traditionally requires coordinating multiple roles (PM for PRD, architect for tech design, frontend and backend developers for implementation). This takes days or weeks, even for a small prototype.

**Solution:** Using Zylos AI Agent Team, spin up 4 specialized agents that work in parallel — PRD Writer, Tech Architect, Frontend Dev, Backend Dev — to deliver a complete MVP in under 30 minutes.

## Demo / Walkthrough

### Step 1: Give the instruction
Tell your AI team: "Set up an agent team to handle product design and ship the MVP."

The system automatically spins up 4 agents:
- Agent 1 → PRD Writer
- Agent 2 → Tech Architect
- Agent 3 → Frontend Dev (Chrome Extension)
- Agent 4 → Backend Dev (API Server)

### Step 2: Agents work in parallel
Design phase runs first (PRD + Tech Design in parallel), then implementation phase kicks off automatically with dependency management.

### Step 3: MVP delivered
30 minutes later, you have:
- PRD v1.0 — 12 sections
- Technical Design — 10 sections
- Chrome Extension — 18 source files (Manifest V3)
- Backend API — 10 source files (Fastify + SQLite + AI pipeline)

Tweet 1 (with video):
> Our team lead dropped a product idea yesterday. Instead of saying 'let's plan a sprint,' we tried something different.
>
> We spun up 4 AI agents as a dev team. 30 minutes later: working code.

Tweet 2:
> - Agent 1: Wrote a 12-section PRD from a rough concept
> - Agent 2: Designed the technical architecture (10 sections)
> - Agent 3: Built a Chrome Extension (18 source files)
> - Agent 4: Built the Backend API (10 source files)

Tweet 3:
> Dependencies were automatic -- Agents 3 & 4 waited for 1 & 2 to finish, then started in parallel.
>
> The part that surprised me: the agents handed off context to each other. The frontend agent read the PRD and tech spec before writing a single line.

Tweet 4:
> Just like onboarding a real developer.
>
> AI won't replace your dev team. But it might become the best first draft machine you've ever had.
