## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Code Review Is Crushing Your Engineering Velocity**

Code review is one of the most important quality gates in software engineering -- and one of the biggest bottlenecks. Studies from Google and Microsoft show that developers spend 20-30% of their working hours reviewing other people's code. For senior engineers, it's often more. The result is a painful paradox: the people best qualified to review code are the same people you desperately need writing it.

The downstream effects are severe. Slow reviews block merges. Blocked merges create integration conflicts. Developers context-switch between writing code and reviewing code, destroying deep work. And when reviews get rushed due to queue pressure, bugs slip through -- the exact outcome the process was designed to prevent.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Code Reviewer integrates directly into your existing Git workflow (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and acts as an always-available first-pass reviewer. Here's the step-by-step workflow:

1. **Automatic Trigger**: When a PR is opened or updated, COCO automatically picks it up. No manual action needed.

2. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: COCO reviews the diff across multiple dimensions simultaneously:
   - **Security**: SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, insecure dependencies, authentication bypasses
   - **Performance**: N+1 queries, unnecessary re-renders, memory leaks, unindexed database queries
   - **Logic**: Edge cases, null pointer risks, race conditions, off-by-one errors
   - **Style**: Adherence to your team's coding standards, naming conventions, file structure
   - **Architecture**: Design pattern violations, coupling issues, separation of concerns

3. **Contextual Comments**: Instead of generic warnings, COCO posts inline comments on the exact lines that need attention, with explanations of why there's an issue and suggested fixes. It understands context -- it won't flag a "magic number" that's clearly a well-known HTTP status code.

4. **Learning Your Codebase**: COCO indexes your repository's patterns, conventions, and architecture. Over time, its reviews become increasingly aligned with your team's specific standards -- not just generic best practices.

5. **Severity Triage**: Issues are categorized as Critical (must fix), Warning (should fix), and Suggestion (nice to have). This lets developers prioritize effectively instead of wading through a flat list.

6. **Human Reviewer Routing**: After COCO's first pass, the PR is routed to the most appropriate human reviewer based on code ownership, expertise area, and current workload. The human reviewer sees COCO's analysis and focuses only on architectural decisions, business logic correctness, and design trade-offs.

**Measurable Results**

Teams using COCO's AI Code Reviewer report:
- **68% reduction** in average PR review turnaround time
- **73% increase** in bugs caught before merge
- **85% reduction** in security vulnerabilities reaching production
- **11+ hours/week** freed up per senior engineer
- **40% fewer** review-related Slack messages and context switches

**Who Benefits**

- **Engineering Leaders**: Faster shipping velocity without sacrificing quality
- **Senior Engineers**: Freed from repetitive review work to focus on architecture and mentoring
- **Junior Engineers**: Faster feedback loops accelerate learning and reduce "waiting on review" blocks
- **Security Teams**: Consistent security scanning on every single PR, not just periodic audits

## Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Security-Focused Code Review**
```
Review this pull request for security vulnerabilities. Focus on:
1. SQL injection or NoSQL injection risks
2. Cross-site scripting (XSS) vectors
3. Hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
4. Insecure deserialization
5. Authentication/authorization bypass risks
6. Insecure direct object references

For each issue found, explain the attack vector, severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low), and provide a secure code fix. Here's the diff:

[paste PR diff]
```

**Prompt 2: Performance Review for Database-Heavy Code**
```
Analyze this code change for performance issues, specifically:
1. N+1 query patterns (identify each instance)
2. Missing database indexes for new queries
3. Unbounded queries that could return massive result sets
4. Opportunities to batch operations instead of looping
5. Unnecessary data loading (selecting columns we don't use)

Our stack is [Python/Django with PostgreSQL / Node.js with MongoDB / etc.]. Current table sizes: users (~2M rows), orders (~15M rows), products (~500K rows).

Suggest optimized alternatives for each issue with expected performance improvement. Here's the code:

[paste code]
```

**Prompt 3: Full PR Review with Team Standards**
```
Review this PR as a senior engineer on our team. Our standards:
- Language: TypeScript strict mode
- Style: Airbnb ESLint config, Prettier defaults
- Testing: Minimum 80% branch coverage for new code
- Patterns: Repository pattern for data access, dependency injection
- Error handling: Custom error classes, no bare catch blocks
- Naming: camelCase variables, PascalCase types, SCREAMING_SNAKE constants

Review for: logic errors, edge cases, style violations, test coverage gaps, and architecture concerns. Categorize each finding as [MUST FIX], [SHOULD FIX], or [SUGGESTION].

**Prompt 4: Legacy Code Refactoring Review**
```
This PR refactors a legacy module. Review it for:
1. Are there any behavioral changes that might break existing functionality?
2. Is the refactoring complete, or are there leftover legacy patterns?
3. Are there new abstractions that add complexity without clear benefit?
4. Is backward compatibility maintained for the public API?
5. Are there adequate tests covering the refactored paths?

**Prompt 5: Review Summary for Engineering Manager**
```
Generate an executive summary of this PR suitable for a non-technical engineering manager. Include:
1. What this change does in plain language (2-3 sentences)
2. Risk assessment (Low/Medium/High) with justification
3. Areas that need human review attention
4. Estimated blast radius if something goes wrong
5. Rollback complexity (simple revert vs. data migration needed)
