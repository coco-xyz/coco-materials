# #7 - AI Deploy Monitor

**Category**: DevOps / SRE
**Pain**: Production goes down at 3am, the on-call engineer gets paged, spends an hour figuring out what broke, then manually rolls back
**Solution**: COCO AI agent watches every deployment in real time — detects anomalies, diagnoses the issue, and auto-rollbacks before your team even wakes up
**Metric**: 3am manual incident response → fully automated detection + rollback

Your on-call engineer got paged at 3am. Spent an hour finding the bad deploy. Rolled back manually. Went back to sleep at 5am.

Our AI deploy monitor catches bad deploys in 90 seconds and auto-rollbacks. Zero human intervention.
