**Role**: FP&A Manager / Controller / CFO | **Industry**: Enterprise, Technology, Any | **Task**: Monitoring

## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Budget variances are discovered quarterly; by then, departments have overspent by millions**

Budget variances are discovered quarterly; by then, departments have overspent by millions. This isn't just an inconvenience — it's a measurable drag on the business. Teams that face this challenge report spending an average of 15-30 hours per week on manual workarounds that could be automated.

The real cost goes beyond the immediate time waste. When fp&a managers are stuck in reactive mode, strategic work doesn't happen. Opportunities are missed. Competitors who have solved this problem move faster, ship sooner, and serve customers better.

Most teams have tried to address this with a combination of spreadsheets, manual processes, and good intentions. The problem is that these approaches don't scale. What works for 10 items breaks at 100. What works for 100 collapses at 1,000. And in today's environment, you're dealing with thousands.

**How COCO Solves It**

1. **Monitors spending against budget**: Monitors spending against budget in real-time across all cost centers. COCO handles this end-to-end, requiring minimal configuration and zero ongoing maintenance. The system learns from your specific patterns and improves over time.

2. **Predicts month-end and quarter-end**: Predicts month-end and quarter-end variances from current run rates. COCO handles this end-to-end, requiring minimal configuration and zero ongoing maintenance. The system learns from your specific patterns and improves over time.

3. **Auto-alerts budget owners when**: Auto-alerts budget owners when spending trends toward overrun. COCO handles this end-to-end, requiring minimal configuration and zero ongoing maintenance. The system learns from your specific patterns and improves over time.
