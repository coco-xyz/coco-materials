## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Debugging Is the Biggest Hidden Tax on Engineering Productivity**

Debugging is where engineering time goes to die. Studies from Cambridge University estimate that developers spend 50% of their programming time finding and fixing bugs. Of that, the majority is spent on diagnosis -- not the fix itself. The fix is often one line. Finding that line takes hours.

The knowledge asymmetry is the core problem. The error message tells you what happened, but not why. The stack trace shows you where the crash occurred, but not the upstream cause. To bridge that gap, a developer needs to hold the entire system's context in their head: how data flows between services, what assumptions each function makes, what changed recently, and what could have cascaded to cause this specific failure.

Senior developers debug faster because they carry this context from experience. But even they hit walls when the bug crosses service boundaries, involves timing-dependent behavior, or stems from a change made by someone else weeks ago. And junior developers? They're often stuck for entire days on bugs that a senior would solve in 20 minutes -- because they lack the contextual mental model.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Debug Assistant acts as a senior debugging partner that has read your entire codebase, understands your architecture, and can correlate errors with recent changes.

1. **Contextual Error Analysis**: When you paste an error, stack trace, or unexpected behavior description, COCO doesn't just read the error message. It:
   - Parses the full stack trace to understand the execution path
   - Reads the relevant source files at the lines referenced
   - Examines the types, interfaces, and data flow around the error location
   - Checks recent git commits to see if something changed near the error site
   - Searches for similar past errors in your error tracking system

2. **Root Cause Chain**: COCO traces the causal chain backward from the symptom to the root cause. For example:
   - **Symptom**: "Cannot read property 'email' of undefined"
   - **Immediate cause**: `user` object is undefined at line 47
   - **Upstream cause**: `findUserById` returned null because the query uses `user_id` but the column was renamed to `account_id` in migration #283
   - **Root cause**: Migration was applied but the ORM model wasn't updated to reflect the column rename

3. **Fix Suggestions with Diffs**: COCO doesn't just explain the problem -- it generates the fix as a code diff you can apply directly. It considers:
   - The minimal change that fixes the bug without side effects
   - Whether the fix should include a null check, a migration, a schema change, or a configuration update
   - Related code that might have the same bug pattern

4. **Performance Debugging**: Beyond errors, COCO helps diagnose performance issues:
   - Identifies slow database queries from explain plans
   - Spots N+1 query patterns in ORM code
   - Detects memory leaks from heap snapshots
   - Analyzes slow API response times by tracing the request lifecycle

5. **Log Analysis**: COCO can ingest log files and:
   - Filter signal from noise in verbose logs
   - Identify patterns and anomalies across thousands of log lines
   - Correlate timestamps across multiple services to reconstruct request flows
   - Spot error patterns that precede failures

6. **Knowledge Accumulation**: Every debug session teaches COCO more about your system. Over time, it builds a model of:
   - Common failure modes in your codebase
   - Which components are fragile and why
   - Recurring patterns in bugs (e.g., "every time the cache TTL config changes, these three endpoints break")

**Measurable Results**

- **Debugging time reduced** from 9.2 to 3.4 hours/developer/week (63% reduction)
- **Bug resolution time (MTTR)** reduced by 58%
- **Junior developer productivity** improved 40% (faster ramp-up through AI-assisted learning)
- **Recurring bug patterns** identified and systematically eliminated, reducing bug recurrence by 45%
- **5.8 hours/developer/week** returned to feature development

**Who Benefits**

- **All Developers**: Faster diagnosis means less frustration and more flow state time
- **Junior Developers**: AI pair debugging accelerates learning and reduces dependency on senior mentors
- **Engineering Managers**: Quantifiable reduction in debugging overhead; more time on feature work
- **On-Call Engineers**: Faster incident diagnosis during outages

## Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Error Diagnosis with Full Context**
```
Help me debug this error. Here's all the context:

Error message and stack trace:
[paste full error output]

Relevant source code (the file(s) referenced in the stack trace):
[paste code]

What was I doing when the error occurred:
[describe the action/request that triggered it]

Recent changes (last few commits that touched this area):
[paste git log or describe changes]

Environment: [Node.js 20 / Python 3.12 / etc.] running on [local / staging / production]

Trace the root cause chain from symptom to origin. Then provide a fix as a code diff.
```

**Prompt 2: Performance Issue Diagnosis**
```
This API endpoint is responding slowly. Help me find the bottleneck.

Endpoint: [METHOD] [path]
Average response time: [X]ms (expected: [Y]ms)
Slow under: [all conditions / high load / specific requests]

Here's the handler code and all functions it calls:
[paste code including database queries, external API calls, etc.]

Database query explain plans (if available):
[paste EXPLAIN output]

Application logs for a slow request:
[paste logs with timestamps]

Identify:
1. The specific bottleneck(s) causing slowness
2. Why it's slow (algorithmic complexity, missing index, synchronous blocking, etc.)
3. Optimized code with expected improvement
```

**Prompt 3: Reproduce and Fix Intermittent Bug**
```
I have an intermittent bug that I can't consistently reproduce. Help me narrow it down.

Symptoms: [describe what goes wrong]
Frequency: [happens ~X% of the time / only under certain conditions]
When it started: [approximate date or deploy]

What I've tried:
[list debugging steps already taken]

Relevant code:
[paste the code area where the bug manifests]

Logs from a failing instance:
[paste]

Logs from a succeeding instance (same operation):
[paste]

Analyze the differences between the failing and succeeding cases. Identify likely causes (race condition, timing, data-dependent, environment-dependent). Suggest a reproduction strategy and fix.
```

**Prompt 4: Memory Leak Investigation**
```
Our [Node.js/Python/Java] service memory usage grows steadily until it OOMs every [X hours].

Current memory profile:
- Startup: [X]MB
- After 1 hour: [X]MB
- After 4 hours: [X]MB
- OOM threshold: [X]MB

Heap snapshot summary (if available):
[paste top retained objects/sizes]

Suspected area of code:
[paste code that handles the most data or creates the most objects]

Recent changes that might have introduced the leak:
[paste or describe]

Analyze for common leak patterns: event listeners not removed, closures retaining references, growing caches without eviction, streams not properly closed, circular references preventing GC. Provide specific fix recommendations.
```

**Prompt 5: Log-Based Incident Investigation**
```
An incident occurred and I need to understand what happened from these logs. The logs are from [number] services over a [X minute] window.

Service A logs:
[paste]

Service B logs:
[paste]

Service C logs:
[paste]

Timeline context:
- Incident reported at: [time]
- Services involved: [list]
- User impact: [description]

Correlate the logs across services to reconstruct:
1. The sequence of events leading to the incident
2. The first point of failure
3. How the failure propagated between services
4. The root cause
5. Timeline of impact start to recovery
```
