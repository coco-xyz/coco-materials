# #340 — AI Customer Onboarding Playbook Builder — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Customer Success / Customer Onboarding
**Metric**: 6.4 hours → 15 minutes per onboarding playbook

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: CSM at laptop, three browser tabs open, frantically copy-pasting from old Notion templates at 9 PM
[Voiceover]: "Your newest customer signs on Monday. Their onboarding playbook isn't ready — and you have 40 other accounts to manage."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Split screen — generic onboarding deck on left, customer's unique tech stack and goals on right, no connection between them
[Voiceover]: "The average SaaS CSM spends 6+ hours building each onboarding plan from scratch. The result? A template with the customer's name on it — and a 19% churn rate in the first 90 days."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: CSM pastes intake form data into COCO, a structured playbook appears with phases, milestones, and integration checklist populated
[Voiceover]: "With COCO, paste your intake data. Get a full 30/60/90-day playbook — personalized milestones, integration checklists, risk flags, and three pre-written emails — in under 15 minutes."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: Green milestone checkmarks advancing on a customer dashboard, CSM shaking hands with a happy customer at a QBR
[Voiceover]: "90-day churn cut by more than half. First value achieved in 30 days, not 47. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
