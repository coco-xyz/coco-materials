## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Slow Queries Are the Silent Tax on Every User Interaction**

Slow queries cost $180K/year in cloud compute and 2,300 hours of user wait time. This isn't just an inconvenience — it's a measurable drag on the business. Teams that face this challenge report spending an average of 15-30 hours per week on manual workarounds that could be automated.

The real cost goes beyond the immediate time waste. When database administrators are stuck in reactive mode, strategic work doesn't happen. Opportunities are missed. Competitors who have solved this problem move faster, ship sooner, and serve customers better.

Most teams have tried to address this with a combination of spreadsheets, manual processes, and good intentions. The problem is that these approaches don't scale. What works for 10 items breaks at 100. What works for 100 collapses at 1,000. And in today's environment, you're dealing with thousands.

**How COCO Solves It**

1. **Analyzes query execution plans**: Analyzes query execution plans and suggests optimal indexes. COCO handles this end-to-end, requiring minimal configuration and zero ongoing maintenance. The system learns from your specific patterns and improves over time.

2. **Rewrites slow queries while**: Rewrites slow queries while preserving exact result sets. COCO handles this end-to-end, requiring minimal configuration and zero ongoing maintenance. The system learns from your specific patterns and improves over time.

3. **Predicts capacity needs and**: Predicts capacity needs and prevents performance cliffs. COCO handles this end-to-end, requiring minimal configuration and zero ongoing maintenance. The system learns from your specific patterns and improves over time.

**Measurable Results**

- **Avg Query Time**: 12s → 0.3s
- **Cloud Cost**: -42%
- **DBA Tickets**: 47 → 6
- **Team satisfaction**: Significant improvement reported
- **Time to value**: Results visible within first week
