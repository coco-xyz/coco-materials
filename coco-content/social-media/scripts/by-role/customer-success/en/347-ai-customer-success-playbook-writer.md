# #347 — AI Customer Success Playbook Writer — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Customer Success / Documentation
**Metric**: New CSM ramp 11 weeks → 6 weeks; playbook coverage 28% → 91%

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: New CSM on Day 1 asking "what do I do when a customer goes silent for 30 days?" — senior CSM shrugs and says "well, it depends..."
[Voiceover]: "Your best practices are locked inside your senior CSMs' heads. And they're leaving the building every night."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: New CSM taking notes in a shadowing session, missing half the context, making up their own process 3 months later
[Voiceover]: "Without documented playbooks, new CSMs take 11 weeks to ramp. Customers in those 11 weeks get inconsistent, experience-dependent service. That inconsistency costs you accounts."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: CS leader types the situation, COCO generates a complete playbook with trigger, action steps, email templates, escalation path, and failure modes
[Voiceover]: "Tell COCO the situation. Get a complete playbook — with step-by-step actions, embedded email templates, escalation criteria, and failure modes documented — in 90 minutes instead of 12 hours."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: New CSM confidently following a playbook on screen, churn in playbook-covered segments dropping
[Voiceover]: "Ramp time cut to 6 weeks. Playbook coverage from 28% to 91%. Churn in documented segments: 9.1%. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
