::: details Pain Point & How COCO Solves It

**The Pain: Manual Expense Auditing Is Slow, Incomplete, and Expensive**

Expense report auditing is one of those necessary finance functions that everyone knows is broken but nobody fixes. The process is labor-intensive, error-prone, and still misses significant policy violations and fraud. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners estimates that organizations lose 5% of revenue to fraud, with expense reimbursement fraud being one of the most common types.

Manual auditing has a fundamental sampling problem. When reviewing 1,200 reports takes 160 hours, finance teams resort to sampling -- auditing 20-30% of reports in detail and rubber-stamping the rest. This means 70-80% of expense reports receive minimal scrutiny, creating a known vulnerability that sophisticated bad actors exploit.

The errors aren't just fraud. Honest mistakes are rampant: employees who don't know the policy, receipts that don't match claimed amounts due to currency conversion, duplicate submissions from confusing expense systems, and miscategorized expenses that distort departmental budgets. These errors, individually small, compound into material financial inaccuracies.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Expense Auditor provides 100% audit coverage with consistent policy enforcement.

1. **Receipt Processing**: OCR reads receipt images in any format -- paper scans, phone photos, PDF downloads, even screenshots. Extracts vendor name, date, amount, tax, and category. Cross-references against the claimed values. Flags mismatches with the exact discrepancy amount.

2. **Policy Compliance Engine**: Checks every line item against your full expense policy:
   - Meal limits (per person, per event, by meal type)
   - Hotel rate caps (by city tier, season, advance booking)
   - Flight booking windows (advance purchase requirements, class restrictions)
   - Entertainment policies (client presence required, per-event limits, description requirements)
   - Mileage rates (IRS standard vs. company rate, route verification)
   - Per diem rules (domestic vs. international, city-specific rates)
   - Approval thresholds (who needs to approve at each dollar level)

3. **Pattern Detection**: Identifies suspicious patterns across time and across submitters:
   - **Split transactions**: Breaking a $300 dinner into two $150 receipts to stay below the $200 approval limit
   - **Round numbers**: Too many expenses at exactly $50, $100, $75 -- likely estimates rather than actuals
   - **Weekend/holiday anomalies**: Expenses on non-work days without corresponding travel authorization
   - **Vendor frequency**: Same restaurant 15 times in a month raises questions
   - **Threshold gaming**: 8 out of 10 expenses at $49 when the receipt requirement starts at $50
   - **Cross-employee patterns**: Two employees claiming the same dinner on different reports

4. **Risk Scoring**: Each expense report gets a risk score (0-100):
   - **0-20**: Clean, auto-approve
   - **21-50**: Minor issues, auto-approve with notation
   - **51-75**: Review recommended (specific items flagged with policy citations)
   - **76-100**: High risk, mandatory human review with full analysis attached

5. **Smart Routing**: Based on risk score and issue type:
   - Clean reports: Auto-approved, no human touch needed
   - Medium-risk: Flagged items sent to submitter for clarification before approval
   - High-risk: Escalated to finance manager with full analysis, policy citations, and historical context

6. **Reporting and Analytics**: Monthly and quarterly dashboards:
   - Policy compliance rates by department, team, and individual
   - Top violation types and trends over time
   - Estimated cost savings from fraud prevention and error correction
   - Department-level spending patterns and budget impact
   - Recommendations for policy updates based on common edge cases

::: details Pain Point & How COCO Solves It

**The Pain: FP&A Teams Are Report Factories, Not Strategic Advisors**

FP&A teams exist to provide strategic financial insight. In practice, they spend most of their time assembling reports. McKinsey research shows that finance teams spend 60-70% of their time on data gathering and report preparation, leaving only 30-40% for actual analysis and strategic support. The irony: CFOs consistently rank "strategic business partnering" as FP&A's most important function -- and the one where they most underdeliver.

The monthly close and reporting cycle is the biggest time drain. FP&A analysts pull data from multiple systems (ERP, CRM, HRIS, billing), reconcile discrepancies, calculate variances, build charts, format reports, and write commentary -- the same process, with the same templates, every single month. It's highly skilled work done in a highly repetitive way.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Financial Report Generator automates the data assembly, calculation, and narrative generation, freeing FP&A for strategic work.

1. **Automated Data Integration**: Connects to financial systems (ERP, CRM, billing, HRIS) and pulls actuals, budget, and prior-period data automatically.

2. **Report Generation**: Produces standard monthly reports: P&L, balance sheet, cash flow, departmental budgets, revenue analysis, headcount, and KPI dashboards -- all formatted to your templates with accurate calculations.

3. **Intelligent Variance Commentary**: COCO doesn't just calculate "Revenue +12%." It explains why: identifies the drivers (which segments, products, regions contributed), quantifies each driver's impact, and contextualizes against plan assumptions.

4. **Board Deck Assembly**: Generates first-draft board presentations with executive summary, financial highlights, key metrics, risk/opportunity flags, and forward-looking guidance.

5. **Forecast Updates**: Based on actuals-to-date, COCO updates rolling forecasts, highlights tracking vs. plan, and flags items requiring reforecasting.

6. **Anomaly Detection**: Flags unusual patterns in financial data: unexpected account balance changes, budget line items significantly over/under, and trends that deviate from historical patterns.

::: details Pain Point & How COCO Solves It

**The Pain: AP Is the Most Labor-Intensive Function in Finance**

Accounts payable processing is among the most repetitive, error-prone, and underappreciated functions in any organization. The Institute of Financial Operations estimates that manual invoice processing costs $12-15 per invoice when you factor in labor, errors, late fees, and lost early payment discounts.

For a mid-size company processing 3,000+ invoices monthly, that's $36,000-45,000 per month in processing costs alone. The errors -- duplicate payments, incorrect amounts, wrong GL coding -- add another layer of cost through rework, vendor disputes, and audit findings.

The format problem makes automation seem impossible. Invoices arrive via email (PDF attachments), postal mail (scanned paper), supplier portals (various export formats), and increasingly, photos taken on phones. Each vendor has a different layout, terminology, and numbering system. Traditional template-based OCR breaks the moment it encounters an unfamiliar format.

And the matching problem is worse. A vendor named "Widget Corporation Inc." on the PO might appear as "Widget Corp" or "Widget Corp." or "WidgetCo" on the invoice. Line items may be bundled differently: the PO says "100 units of Product A at $10 each" while the invoice says "Product A -- 50 shipped Jan 5, 50 shipped Jan 12, total $1,000." Same transaction, different representation. Humans handle this intuitively. Rules-based systems fail.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Invoice Processor automates the entire AP workflow from receipt to payment.

1. **Intelligent Document Processing**: Reads invoices in any format using advanced OCR and NLP:
   - Extracts vendor name, invoice number, date, line items, quantities, unit prices, tax, and total
   - Handles any layout -- no templates needed for new vendors
   - Reads handwritten notes, stamps, and annotations on paper invoices
   - Processes invoices embedded in email bodies (not just attachments)
   - Handles multi-page invoices and consolidated billing statements

2. **Automated PO Matching**: Fuzzy-matches invoices to purchase orders with intelligence:
   - Handles vendor name variations ("Widget Corp" = "Widget Corporation Inc.")
   - Matches partial deliveries and split shipments to a single PO
   - Reconciles line-item splits (PO says 100 units; invoice says 50+50)
   - Handles pricing variations from contract terms (volume discounts, tiered pricing)
   - Identifies invoices without POs for non-PO workflows (recurring services, utilities)

3. **Three-Way Match**: Compares PO, invoice, and goods receipt at the line-item level:
   - Quantity verification: ordered vs. invoiced vs. received
   - Price verification: agreed price vs. invoiced price
   - Tax calculation: verifies tax amounts against applicable rates
   - Flags specific discrepancies with details: "Line 3: PO price $10.00, Invoice price $10.50, difference $50.00 on 100 units"
   - Tolerance thresholds: auto-approves minor variances within configured limits

4. **GL Account Coding**: Auto-assigns general ledger codes:
   - Based on vendor, expense category, department, and project
   - Learns from historical coding patterns (this vendor always coded to 6100-Marketing)
   - Handles cost center allocation for shared expenses
   - Flags unusual coding for review (same vendor, different GL code than usual)

5. **Approval Routing**: Routes invoices based on configurable rules:
   - Amount thresholds ($0-$5K: auto-approve; $5K-$25K: department head; $25K+: VP)
   - Department and cost center routing
   - Special approval requirements (capital expenses, new vendors, contract changes)
   - Escalation for overdue approvals (reminder at 48h, escalation at 72h)
   - Mobile approval for managers on the go

6. **Payment Optimization**: Schedules payments to maximize value:
   - Captures early payment discounts (2/10 net 30: pay on day 10, save 2%)
   - Maintains cash flow targets (don't pay everything early if cash is tight)
   - Batches payments to reduce transaction costs
   - Prioritizes vendor payments based on relationship importance and terms
   - Forecasts upcoming payment obligations for cash flow planning
