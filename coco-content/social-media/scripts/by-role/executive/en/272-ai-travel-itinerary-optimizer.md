# #272 - AI Travel Itinerary Optimizer — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Executive / Scheduling
**Metric**: 4-6 hours of trip planning → 45-minute optimized itinerary package

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: Executive frantically switching between 12 browser tabs — airline sites, hotel pages, Google Maps, calendar — while a phone buzzes with urgent messages.
[Voiceover]: "You spend 5 hours planning every business trip. Then you still end up in the wrong hotel, miles from your first meeting."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Split screen — one side shows a stressed EA manually mapping meeting locations; the other shows an executive stuck in traffic, late for a client meeting.
[Voiceover]: "Executives average 30 business trips a year. Poorly planned itineraries waste 90 minutes per trip in unnecessary transit, cause missed connections, and mean arriving underprepared. That's 45 hours a year lost to bad travel logistics."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: Clean COCO interface — user pastes meeting list, COCO maps locations, suggests optimal hotel, builds a day-by-day itinerary with buffer times and a contingency plan.
[Voiceover]: "Paste your meetings into COCO. It maps locations, clusters them geographically, picks the closest hotel, builds your day-by-day schedule with realistic buffers — and prepares contingency plans for every high-risk leg. In 45 minutes."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: Executive reviewing a clean, complete itinerary on a phone at the airport — calm, coffee in hand, fully prepared.
[Voiceover]: "Complete trip. Zero scrambling. 5 hours of planning compressed to 45 minutes — try COCO at coco.xyz"
