# #341 — AI Churn Risk Early Warning System — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Customer Success / Monitoring
**Metric**: Churn detection lead time 12 days → 52 days before cancellation

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: CSM opening a cancellation email, shocked — the account's health score was "green" just last month
[Voiceover]: "They churned. The signs were there for two months. Nobody caught them in time."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Spreadsheet with dozens of accounts, manual health scores, CSM manually scanning rows late at night
[Voiceover]: "A CSM managing 50 accounts can't monitor 15 behavioral signals per customer every week. By the time churn is obvious, it's already too late — recovery rates drop from 42% to 18% after 30 days."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: CSM pastes weekly account data into COCO; risk-ranked list appears showing Critical/Elevated/Watch tiers with specific evidence and intervention plans
[Voiceover]: "Paste your weekly account data into COCO. Get a risk-ranked portfolio view with root causes, specific evidence, and ready-to-send intervention emails — before it's too late."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: CSM proactively calling a customer 52 days before renewal, health scores turning green across the portfolio
[Voiceover]: "Cut gross churn from 12% to 7.4%. Catch problems 52 days earlier. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
