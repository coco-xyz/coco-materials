# #276 - AI Knowledge Base Curator — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Executive / Knowledge Management
**Metric**: 2.5 hours/day searching for information → 60% less search time

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: Executive frantically searching through dozens of Drive folders, Notion pages, email threads — looking increasingly frustrated.
[Voiceover]: "You know that insight exists somewhere. It's just in a folder, a Slack message, someone's memory — from two years ago."

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Knowledge worker at desk. Timer graphic: 2.5 hours per day on search. Then: senior employee packs box, walks out. Caption: "And when they leave, it all goes with them."
[Voiceover]: "Knowledge workers spend 2.5 hours a day searching for information — and fail to find it half the time. And when people leave? The institutional knowledge walks out the door with them. That's your competitive advantage, disappearing."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: User drops messy meeting notes into COCO — bullet points, rough text. COCO extracts structured insights, tags them, links to related knowledge. Later: user asks "What do we know about [competitor]?" — COCO pulls a synthesized answer with sources and confidence levels.
[Voiceover]: "Drop your meeting notes, articles, and insights into COCO. It extracts what matters, tags it, links related knowledge — and when you need it, surfaces the right answer in seconds."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: New team member, first week, confidently accessing organized knowledge base. Senior leader preparing for client meeting with a pre-built knowledge pull.
[Voiceover]: "60% less search time. Knowledge that compounds instead of disappearing. — Try COCO at coco.xyz"
