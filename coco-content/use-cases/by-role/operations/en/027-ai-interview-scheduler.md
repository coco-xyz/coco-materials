# #27 - AI Interview Scheduler

**Category**: HR / Recruiting Operations
**Pain**: Coordinating interview times across candidates and a 4-person panel takes 45 minutes of back-and-forth per candidate
**Solution**: COCO's AI agent checks everyone's calendars, finds optimal slots, sends invites, and handles rescheduling
**Metric**: 45 min per candidate --> 3 minutes
