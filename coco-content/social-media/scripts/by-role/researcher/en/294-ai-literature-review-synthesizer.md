# #294 - AI Literature Review Synthesizer — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Researcher / Research
**Metric**: 6–12 weeks of manual synthesis → 1–2 weeks with COCO

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: A researcher buried under stacks of printed papers, surrounded by sticky notes, highlighters, and multiple open browser tabs showing academic databases
[Voiceover]: "400 hours. That's how long the average researcher spends on a literature review before writing a single word of original work."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Split screen — left side shows a researcher frantically reading and taking notes; right side shows a counter: "Papers read: 47 / Papers to review: 312"
[Voiceover]: "With 300+ papers to read, critical contradictions get missed. Landmark studies in adjacent fields slip through. And the thematic synthesis that should take weeks ends up taking months — if it gets done at all. Journals reject 34% of papers for incomplete literature treatment."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: Researcher uploads a batch of PDFs into COCO; thematic clusters materialize as an interactive map; contradictions are flagged with side-by-side evidence; a structured outline appears
[Voiceover]: "With COCO, upload your corpus and get thematic clusters, contradiction maps, and identified research gaps in under an hour. COCO reads 300 papers so you can synthesize with confidence — not hope you didn't miss anything important."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: Researcher reviewing a polished literature review draft, submitting to a journal, then receiving an acceptance notification
[Voiceover]: "3x more papers covered. 22% fewer desk rejections. Your literature review done right — Try COCO at coco.xyz"
