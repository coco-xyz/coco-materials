# #297 - AI Academic Paper Summarizer — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Researcher / Research
**Metric**: 5–8x more papers processed at research-synthesis quality

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: A researcher surrounded by a towering stack of printed papers, a countdown timer showing "412 papers remaining"
[Voiceover]: "52% of researchers cite papers they haven't fully read. The field is too big. The time is too short. Until now."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Researcher opening a PDF, reading for 20 minutes, then writing a vague note: "something about self-efficacy and performance — cite this." Cut to: that vague note appearing in a published paper, propagating into a citation chain
[Voiceover]: "When you can't read everything, details blur. Sample size. Effect size. Whether the finding even replicates. Methodological nuance gets lost — and errors propagate through citation chains for decades."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: Researcher uploads 50 PDFs to COCO; structured summaries appear for each — research question, sample, methods, key finding with effect size, limitations, citation-ready sentence; a batch overview shows thematic clusters
[Voiceover]: "COCO extracts structured summaries — research question, sample characteristics, effect sizes, limitations, and a citation-ready sentence — for every paper in your corpus. Process 50 papers in the time it takes to read 6."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: Researcher confidently writing a literature review with precise citations, submitting it, receiving positive peer review comments on literature depth
[Voiceover]: "5x more papers. 3x more methodological detail. Zero vague citations — Try COCO at coco.xyz"
