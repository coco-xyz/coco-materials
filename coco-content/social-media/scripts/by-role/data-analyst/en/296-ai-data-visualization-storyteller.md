# #296 - AI Data Visualization Storyteller — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Data Analyst / Reporting
**Metric**: 8 minutes of passive dashboard scanning → actionable decision in the meeting

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: Executive flipping through a 22-chart dashboard for 8 minutes, shrugging, and saying "can we get more analysis on this?"
[Voiceover]: "Your analysis had the answer. The story was never told."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Analyst's screen showing a technically perfect but narratively useless dashboard — 23 metrics, equal visual weight, no clear message highlighted
[Voiceover]: "Analysts are trained in SQL, Python, and Tableau — not in how to build an argument from data. The result? Insights buried in chart 14 of 22. Executives request more analysis. Nothing gets decided. Research shows organizations where analysts can tell data stories are 23 times more likely to acquire customers."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: Analyst pastes findings into COCO; executive summary appears with SCQA structure; chart type recommendations replace the wrong visualizations; slide titles become declarative sentences encoding the finding
[Voiceover]: "COCO transforms your raw findings into a narrative executives act on. Get the right chart type, a pyramid-principle executive summary, and slide titles that encode the insight — not just label the topic."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: Clean 7-slide presentation; executive makes a clear decision in the meeting; analyst receives a positive Slack message
[Voiceover]: "34% higher decision rates. 41% fewer follow-up requests. Tell the story your data already knows — Try COCO at coco.xyz"
