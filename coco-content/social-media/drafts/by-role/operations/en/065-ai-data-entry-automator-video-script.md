# Video Script: AI Data Entry Automator
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Stacks of paper documents cascade across screen, transforming into digital data streams.]
Voiceover: "Your operations team spends 2.5 hours a day copying numbers from one system to another. That's 600 hours a week for a 50-person team -- gone."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows a tired worker manually typing from a paper invoice into a spreadsheet. Right side shows error notifications multiplying. A counter ticks up: "Error rate: 1%... 2%... 3%".]
Voiceover: "Manual data entry doesn't just waste time. A 1-4% error rate means thousands of dollars in reconciliation costs, delayed shipments, and compliance headaches every single month."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears with a warm glow. Smooth transition to a workflow animation: documents flow in from email, scanned images, and spreadsheets. COCO extracts, validates, and routes data into ERP/CRM systems. Green checkmarks appear on each step.]
Key features:
  - Reads any format: PDFs, scans, handwritten forms, spreadsheets
  - Cross-validates every field before entry -- vendor IDs, SKUs, totals
  - Routes exceptions to humans with context, not guesswork
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Data Entry Automator reads documents in any format, validates every field against your records, and enters data directly into your systems -- with a full audit trail."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Warm gold upward arrows. Clean dashboard showing: 94% less manual entry, 99.7% accuracy, 83% faster processing.]
Voiceover: "94% less manual entry. 99.7% accuracy. Your team finally works on things that actually matter."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered on warm yellow background. URL fades in below. Subtle particle glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
