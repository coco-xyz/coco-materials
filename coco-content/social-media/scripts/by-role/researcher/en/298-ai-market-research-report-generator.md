**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Analyst bouncing between Statista, G2, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, Gong recordings, and interview transcripts — all with different formats, different logins, no synthesis
[Voiceover]: "Market research analysts spend 70% of their time gathering and formatting — not analyzing. The result: outdated reports, missed competitive shifts, and decisions made on January data in April."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: Researcher feeds competitor data, customer interview notes, and market signals into COCO; a competitive positioning matrix generates; a customer segment profile appears; a bottom-up TAM model builds with sensitivity analysis; an executive summary writes itself
[Voiceover]: "COCO synthesizes competitive intelligence, customer research, and market sizing into a structured, decision-ready report — in days, not weeks. No agency required."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
