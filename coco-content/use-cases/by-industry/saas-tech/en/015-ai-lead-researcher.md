## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: SDRs Spend More Time Researching Than Selling**

The modern SDR role has a fundamental efficiency problem. Personalized outreach is table stakes -- generic emails get deleted, templated LinkedIn messages get ignored. But genuine personalization requires genuine research: understanding the prospect's company, their role, their pain points, their current tech stack, and their recent activities.

Research from Gartner shows that SDRs spend only 28% of their time actually selling. The rest is consumed by research, data entry, administrative tasks, and navigating tools. For many SDRs, the research phase alone takes 30-60 minutes per prospect -- and they need to reach 50-100 prospects per week to generate enough pipeline.

The second problem is qualification accuracy. Without thorough research, SDRs often pursue prospects who don't fit the ideal customer profile. These conversations waste time for both sides and clog the pipeline with low-quality opportunities that AEs then have to disqualify.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Lead Researcher automates the research and qualification process, delivering SDR-ready intelligence in minutes instead of hours.

1. **Automated Multi-Source Research**: Given a prospect name and company, COCO aggregates:
   - **Professional Profile**: Role history, tenure, responsibilities, skills, education
   - **Company Intelligence**: Size, revenue, industry, growth stage, recent news, funding rounds
   - **Tech Stack**: Current tools and technologies (from BuiltWith, job postings, integration pages)
   - **Competitive Context**: Current vendors, recently evaluated alternatives, G2/Capterra reviews
   - **Growth Signals**: Hiring velocity, new office locations, product launches, partnership announcements
   - **Social Activity**: Recent LinkedIn posts, conference appearances, published articles, podcast interviews

2. **ICP Scoring and Qualification**: Before a single minute of human time is spent, COCO:
   - Scores the prospect against your defined Ideal Customer Profile
   - Flags disqualifying factors (wrong industry, too small, already using competitor with long contract)
   - Highlights qualifying signals (recent funding, hiring for relevant roles, technology migration)
   - Assigns a priority tier (Hot / Warm / Cold / Disqualify)

3. **Personalized Prospect Brief**: For qualified prospects, COCO generates a one-page brief:
   - **Company Snapshot**: What they do, how big, what stage, recent momentum
   - **Prospect Profile**: Role, likely priorities, decision-making authority
   - **Pain Point Hypothesis**: Based on role + company stage + industry, what problems they likely face that your product solves
   - **Conversation Starters**: Specific hooks from recent activity (e.g., "You posted about scaling your CS team -- we helped [similar company] automate 40% of ticket volume")
   - **Connection Points**: Mutual connections, shared alma maters, common interests, event co-attendance
   - **Risk Factors**: Potential objections or blockers to flag early

4. **Personalized Outreach Drafts**: COCO generates channel-specific first-touch drafts:
   - **Email**: Subject line + body with specific, non-generic personalization hooks
   - **LinkedIn**: Connection request note + follow-up message
   - **Cold Call Script**: Opening, pain point probe, value prop bridge, meeting request
   - Each draft references specific research findings, not generic flattery

5. **Account Mapping**: For enterprise deals, COCO maps the buying committee:
   - Economic buyer, technical evaluator, end user champion, blocker
   - Recommended approach sequence (who to contact first, who to involve when)
   - Relationship paths through mutual connections

**Measurable Results**

- **Research time per lead**: From 45 minutes to 3 minutes (93% reduction)
- **Leads researched per SDR per day**: From 8 to 60+ (7.5x increase)
- **Qualified meetings booked per SDR**: +73%
- **Cost per qualified meeting**: -58%
- **Prospect-to-meeting conversion rate**: +41% (better personalization)
- **Pipeline quality (SAL to SQL conversion)**: +35% (better upfront qualification)

**Who Benefits**

- **SDRs/BDRs**: Research at scale without sacrificing personalization quality
- **Sales Managers**: Higher output per rep without increasing headcount
- **AEs**: Receive better-qualified, better-researched meetings from SDRs
- **Revenue Operations**: More accurate pipeline data from better upfront qualification
