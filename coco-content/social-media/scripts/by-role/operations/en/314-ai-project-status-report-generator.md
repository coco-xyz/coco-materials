**Category**: Operations / Reporting
**Metric**: 3–6 hours per report → 60–70% time reduction

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: Project manager at 9 PM, still writing the Friday status report. Project is already two weeks behind schedule. The report says "on track."
[Voiceover]: "Your status report took 4 hours to write. And it still doesn't tell leadership what they need to know."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Steering committee meeting — executives asking questions the status report should have already answered. A project risk that was "noted" two months ago has just become a crisis. An operations manager managing 5 projects drowning in reporting overhead.
[Voiceover]: "Project reporting consumes up to 6 hours a week per project. When reports are vague, risks get buried, decisions are delayed, and small problems become expensive crises. The report exists — but it's not doing the work it's supposed to do."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: Operations manager pasting rough project notes into COCO. A complete status report emerges — RAG ratings with rationale, a structured risk register, an executive summary, and a "decisions needed" section. The report is professional, analytical, and ready in minutes.
[Voiceover]: "Give COCO your project notes. It builds the full status report — RAG analysis, risk register with mitigations, executive summary, and the specific decisions your steering committee needs to make. For every project. Every week. In minutes."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: Crisp, one-page status report on screen. Steering committee making a clear, timely decision. Project back on track.
[Voiceover]: "70% less reporting time. Status reports that drive decisions, not just check boxes — generate yours at coco.xyz"
