# Video Script: AI Feature Impact Estimator
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "30 feature requests. Capacity for 8. And your RICE scores are built on numbers someone said in a meeting — not calculated. 'Reach: 5,000 users.' 'Impact: High.' The framework looks rigorous. The inputs are guesses."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows a roadmap debate where whoever is loudest wins, right side shows a mis-prioritized feature consuming a full quarter of engineering time. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "A single mis-prioritized feature in a quarterly roadmap can consume $200,000 to $400,000 in engineering time. Roadmap debates run 4+ hours. Impact prediction error averages ~45%. Teams build the wrong things with confidence."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Historical launch pattern analysis comparing proposed features to comparable past launches to establish calibrated impact benchmarks
  - Confidence-weighted scoring showing impact ranges like "4-8% retention improvement, medium confidence" — not false-precision single-point estimates
  - Sensitivity analysis testing how priority rankings change if key assumptions are wrong — identifying fragile vs. robust priorities
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Feature Impact Estimator combines historical data, segment analysis, and competitive benchmarks to produce grounded, calibrated impact estimates — cutting prediction error from ~45% to ~22%."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "Teams report 35% fewer 'regret features' — things built that delivered less than half of expected impact. Roadmap debates cut from 4+ hours to under 90 minutes. Teams recover 1-2 misallocated engineering sprints per quarter."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
