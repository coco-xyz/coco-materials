**Category**: Product Manager / Scheduling
**Metric**: 39% action item completion → 67%; 23% velocity improvement over 6 sprint cycles

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: A retrospective board filled with sticky notes under "went well / went poorly / suggestions" — the "went poorly" column has the same three items that appeared in the previous sprint's board visible behind it
[Voiceover]: "Your sprint retro has the same complaints it had three months ago. Nothing changed. Sound familiar?"

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: A team going through the motions — sticky notes, brief discussion, vague action items; then a follow-up meeting where nobody knows what happened to last retro's action items
[Voiceover]: "61% of retrospectives produce zero action items that get tracked to completion. 43% of teams revisit the same themes sprint after sprint. The problem isn't the team — it's that sticky notes without data, specific ownership, and measurement aren't improvements. They're documentation of frustration."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: COCO displaying a sprint data summary (completion rate, PR cycle times, blocker patterns), then generating a tailored retro format with specific facilitation prompts, then evaluating action items for specificity and ownership
[Voiceover]: "COCO prepares each retrospective with real sprint data — completion rates, PR wait times, mid-sprint scope changes — so the discussion starts from facts, not impressions. It picks the right format for each sprint context, generates the facilitation agenda, and evaluates every action item for whether it's specific enough to actually get done."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: A velocity chart trending upward over 6 sprints; a team having an engaged, focused retro discussion
[Voiceover]: "67% action item completion. 23% velocity improvement over six sprints. Retros that actually make the team faster. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
