# Video Script: AI Product Launch Planner
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "PM says 'launching in three weeks.' Engineering thinks that means code is merged. Marketing thinks it means campaigns are live. Sales thinks pricing is approved. CS thinks documentation exists. On launch day, some subset of those things is true — and nobody found out which until 48 hours before."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows 50-80 launch tasks across 6-8 functions with invisible dependencies, right side shows midnight scramble before launch day. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "A moderately complex launch involves 50 to 80 tasks across 6 to 8 functions. Hidden dependencies surface only when something breaks. About 70% of launch tasks remain incomplete on launch day — generating a first-impression that's hard to reverse."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Cross-functional task generation creating a complete, role-assigned task list across engineering, marketing, sales, CS, legal, and analytics — with due dates and dependencies
  - Dependency mapping identifying the critical path and flagging "hidden" dependencies teams don't know are connected until there's a problem
  - Go/no-go criteria checklist defining the minimum conditions that must be true to proceed on the planned date — not a judgment call made at midnight
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Product Launch Planner raises launch task completion from ~70% to 92%+ and cuts launch timeline slippage by 45%. Ready without setup."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "Day-1 support ticket volume down 30% through better CS training and documentation readiness. Post-launch rollbacks reduced 50%. Cross-functional 'we didn't know you needed that' incidents down 35%. PM launch coordination bandwidth drops from 30% to 15% — giving time back for actual product judgment."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
