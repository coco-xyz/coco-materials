# Video Script: AI Cohort Retention Analyzer
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "Your Day-30 retention is 25%. The question isn't 'how do we get it to 30%.' It's: which users in that same signup cohort already retained — and what did they do differently in the first week that the 75% who churned did not?"

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows aggregate retention curves with no within-cohort insight, right side shows blanket onboarding interventions delivering marginal improvement. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "Traditional cohort analysis shows what happened — not why. PMs respond with aggregate solutions: improve onboarding for everyone, add a day-3 email for everyone. These blanket interventions produce marginal results because they ignore the behavioral differences between users who retain and users who churn."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Behavioral cohort segmentation grouping users by what they actually do in the first 7 days — revealing 3-5 distinct behavioral archetypes with dramatically different retention outcomes
  - Aha moment detection quantifying retention lift per early action: "Users who perform X in day 1-3 retain at 2.4x the rate of those who don't"
  - Churn prediction signal identification surfacing Day-1 through Day-7 behaviors that predict Day-30 churn — enabling intervention 14 days before the user is already gone
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Cohort Retention Analyzer takes retention analysis from a 2-3 week analyst project to 4-6 hours — with Day-30 retention improvements of 4-8% achievable within one quarter."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "Churn prediction precision at Day 7 reaches 75-85%. At-risk user identification 14 days out enables proactive intervention with 2-3x higher success rates. Targeted behavioral A/B tests reach significance 30% faster — each 1-point Day-30 retention gain delivers 3-5% LTV increase across the user base."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
