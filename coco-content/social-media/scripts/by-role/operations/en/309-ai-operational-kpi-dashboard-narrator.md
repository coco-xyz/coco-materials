# #309 - AI Operational KPI Dashboard Narrator — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Operations / Reporting
**Metric**: Hours writing KPI reports → 60–75% time reduction

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: Operations manager staring at a dashboard filled with numbers, then spending 3 hours writing a commentary explaining what it all means.
[Voiceover]: "Your dashboard shows everything. Your leadership understands nothing. Sound familiar?"

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Leadership meeting — executives glancing at charts, asking vague questions. Operations manager scrambling to explain why a metric dropped. Report emails sitting unread in inboxes.
[Voiceover]: "Raw numbers don't make decisions — interpretation does. But translating KPIs into business narrative takes hours every week, and even then, leaders often misread what the data is actually saying."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: User pastes current and prior period KPIs into COCO along with brief operational context. COCO instantly generates a structured narrative: executive summary, metric-by-metric commentary, variance hypotheses, and forward-looking projections.
[Voiceover]: "Give COCO your KPI data and operational context. It writes the executive summary, explains the variances, flags what's at risk by month-end, and produces different versions for your CEO email, your management review, and your operations team — in minutes."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: Leadership nodding in a focused review meeting, clear decisions being made, operations manager presenting with confidence rather than scrambling.
[Voiceover]: "75% less report writing time. Leadership that actually understands the data. Make every dashboard actionable — try COCO at coco.xyz"
