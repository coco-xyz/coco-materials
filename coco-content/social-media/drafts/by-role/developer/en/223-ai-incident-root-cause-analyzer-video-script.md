# Video Script: AI Incident Root Cause Analyzer
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "Alert fires. One engineer faces 100,000+ log lines across 15 services, anomalies across 200 dashboards, distributed traces spanning 50 service hops — and a clock ticking. A typical SaaS company loses $5,000 to $50,000 per minute of downtime. The first 30 minutes determine whether this is contained quickly or becomes an all-hands war room."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows an SRE manually correlating signals across fragmented tooling for hours, right side shows a post-mortem report written under time pressure producing shallow learnings. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "Complex multi-service incident root cause analysis averages 4-8 hours manually. Then writing a thorough post-mortem requires reconstructing the timeline from memory — and that work gets deprioritized under the next sprint's pressure, producing post-mortems that don't yield genuine organizational learning."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Multi-signal ingestion processing structured logs, unstructured logs, metrics, and distributed traces simultaneously — with cross-source timestamp alignment and automatic correlation
  - Ranked root cause hypothesis generation with supporting evidence and confidence scores — distinguishing root cause from contributing factors with a causal chain narrative
  - Automated post-mortem draft generation: complete timeline, root cause analysis, blast radius, engineering deep-dive, and executive summary — immediately after containment
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Incident Root Cause Analyzer compresses complex incident root cause identification from 4-8 hours to 45-90 minutes — with a usable post-mortem draft ready the same day."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "65% of significant anomalies caught before customer impact. Engineering investigation time per incident cut 40% through pre-generated hypotheses. Teams using action item tracking see 50% lower recurrence rates within 90 days. Post-mortem timeline completeness: 95% vs. 35% for manually written ones under pressure."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
