**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: CFO approving a budget, then turning to the camera with an honest look: "Is this actually efficient? I have no idea how we compare to anyone else."
[Voiceover]: "Your budget is approved. But is it competitive? Without external benchmarks, you're flying blind."

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Budget review meeting comparing only this year vs. last year. A chart showing G&A at 14% of revenue with no external reference point.
[Voiceover]: "Less than 20% of mid-market companies benchmark their cost structure externally. The other 80% are comparing themselves only to themselves — and missing $1 to $3 million in benchmarkable efficiency opportunities every year."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: Finance analyst inputs cost structure into COCO. COCO maps costs to standard benchmark categories and shows: G&A at 14% vs. industry median of 9%. Dollar gap: $1.5M. Specific sub-functions flagged: IT and HR above benchmark.
[Voiceover]: "COCO maps your cost structure to industry benchmarks — by function, by company size, by stage. It shows exactly where you're above benchmark, by how much in dollars, and what typically drives the gap."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: CFO presenting benchmark data to department heads. Clear, depersonalized targets. G&A efficiency roadmap on screen.
[Voiceover]: "$2.1M in above-benchmark spending identified. Management alignment improved 58%. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
