**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: Angry email from a customer threatening to cancel, CSM staring at screen, unsure where to start
[Voiceover]: "The escalation just landed. You have 20 minutes to respond. What do you say?"

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: CSM writing and deleting draft email, Slacking five different people, no clear plan or timeline
