**Category**: HR / Documentation
**Metric**: 65% less manager time on review writing; 39% higher employee feedback satisfaction

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: Manager at 11 PM, staring at a blank performance review form, deadline banner flashing "DUE TOMORROW"
[Voiceover]: "Performance reviews are due tomorrow. And you've written exactly zero of them."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: A rushed generic review — "good team player, meets expectations" — next to an employee looking deflated reading it
[Voiceover]: "Only 14% of employees say their performance reviews actually inspire improvement. Generic, rushed reviews create legal risk, miss bias, and tell your best people they're invisible."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: Manager typing achievements and development areas for each employee into COCO, complete behavior-specific reviews appearing — with a bias flag highlighted and corrected
[Voiceover]: "Give COCO the key details — goals, achievements, development areas. Get a complete, specific, legally defensible review — with bias checks built in. For every employee. In minutes."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: Employee reading a thoughtful, specific review, nodding with understanding, manager submitting on time and smiling
[Voiceover]: "65% less time writing. 39% better employee satisfaction. No more blank pages. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
