## Social Media Copy

I pulled our CRM data last quarter and found the stat that keeps every sales leader up at night: 44% of reps give up after one follow-up. The industry data says 80% of sales require 5+ touchpoints. We were leaving millions on the table because our reps couldn't keep up with the follow-up volume.

It wasn't laziness. Each rep had 60-80 active opportunities. Every meeting needed a recap email within 2 hours. Every proposal needed a check-in after 3 days. Every quiet deal needed a re-engagement nudge. That's 20-30 follow-up emails per day per rep -- each one needing to be contextual, timely, and not feel like a template.

COCO's AI Follow-up Writer turned our follow-up gap into our competitive advantage:
- After every call/meeting, auto-generates a recap email with action items, next steps, and a personal touch from conversation details
- For quiet deals, writes contextual re-engagement emails: new case study that's relevant, product update they'd care about, industry news that connects to their pain point
- Manages multi-touch sequences that adapt based on prospect behavior (opened but didn't reply = different angle; clicked the case study link = go deeper on ROI)

Follow-up adherence: from 56% to 94%. Average touches per deal: from 2.3 to 6.1. Deals won from "gone dark" re-engagement: 23 last quarter ($1.2M in recovered pipeline).

The deal isn't lost when the prospect says no. It's lost when you stop following up.

## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: The Follow-Up Gap Is Where Revenue Goes to Die**

The math of sales follow-up is brutal and well-documented. Research from the National Sales Executive Association shows that 80% of sales require at least 5 follow-up contacts, yet 44% of salespeople give up after just one. The gap between required follow-ups and actual follow-ups represents the single largest source of lost revenue in most sales organizations.

The root cause isn't discipline -- it's capacity. A typical AE manages 50-80 active opportunities simultaneously. Each opportunity requires different follow-up cadences: post-meeting recaps, proposal follow-ups, competitive displacement nurture, champion coaching emails, executive-level re-engagement. Each email needs to be contextual and personalized -- because prospects can spot a template from a mile away.

The result is triage by gut feel. Reps follow up on deals that feel urgent and let others go cold. The deals that go cold don't announce themselves -- they silently slip away while the rep is busy with louder opportunities.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Follow-up Writer ensures no deal falls through the cracks by generating timely, contextual follow-up communications.

1. **Post-Meeting Recaps**: Within minutes of a meeting ending, COCO generates:
   - Structured summary of key discussion points
   - Clear action items with owners and deadlines
   - Next steps and proposed timeline
   - Personal touch referencing specific conversation moments
   - Appropriate tone (formal for C-suite, casual for technical champions)

2. **Intelligent Sequence Management**: COCO builds follow-up sequences adapted to deal context:
   - **Day 1 (post-meeting)**: Recap + next step confirmation
   - **Day 3 (proposal sent)**: Check-in + highlight key ROI point
   - **Day 7 (no response)**: New angle -- share relevant case study
   - **Day 14 (still quiet)**: Industry insight that connects to their pain
   - **Day 21 (last attempt)**: Direct, honest "should I close this file?" email
   - Each touchpoint adapts based on prospect engagement signals

3. **Behavioral Adaptation**: COCO adjusts messaging based on prospect behavior:
   - Opened email but didn't reply: Try a different angle, shorter message
   - Clicked case study link: Follow up with ROI data from that case
   - Forwarded to colleague: Send multi-stakeholder value content
   - Unsubscribed from marketing: Keep follow-ups personal and manual-feeling
   - No engagement at all: Try a different channel (LinkedIn, phone)

4. **Re-engagement for Dark Deals**: For deals that have gone quiet, COCO:
   - Identifies relevant triggers (prospect company news, industry events, product updates)
   - Crafts re-engagement emails tied to these triggers
   - Suggests optimal timing based on prospect's past engagement patterns
   - Creates multi-channel re-engagement plans (email + LinkedIn + phone)

5. **Stakeholder-Specific Messaging**: Different stakeholders need different messages:
   - **Technical evaluators**: Feature deep-dives, integration details, API documentation
   - **Economic buyers**: ROI summaries, competitive comparisons, risk mitigation
   - **End user champions**: User stories, ease of use, onboarding support
   - **Procurement**: Compliance certifications, SLA details, contract terms

6. **Tone and Timing Intelligence**:
   - Optimizes send time based on prospect's email engagement patterns
   - Adjusts formality based on relationship stage and stakeholder level
   - Avoids over-following-up (spacing and frequency rules)
   - Escalation triggers when follow-ups consistently go unanswered

**Measurable Results**

- **Follow-up adherence**: From 56% to 94% (+68% improvement)
- **Average touches per deal**: From 2.3 to 6.1 (2.7x increase)
- **Deals recovered from "gone dark"**: 23 per quarter ($1.2M recovered pipeline)
- **Email response rate**: +29% (better personalization)
- **Time spent writing follow-ups**: Reduced from 2 hours/day to 25 minutes/day
- **Sales cycle length**: Shortened by 11 days (faster follow-up = faster decisions)

**Who Benefits**

- **Account Executives**: Never miss a follow-up again; every deal gets proper attention
- **SDRs**: Multi-touch sequences that actually convert instead of dying after 2 emails
- **Sales Managers**: Consistent follow-up execution across the team
- **Revenue Operations**: Measurable improvement in pipeline velocity and conversion rates

## Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Post-Meeting Follow-up Email**
```
Write a follow-up email based on this meeting. Make it feel personal and action-oriented, not templated.

Meeting context:
- Prospect: [Name], [Title] at [Company]
- Meeting type: [Discovery call / Demo / Proposal review / Technical deep-dive]
- Key discussion points: [list main topics discussed]
- Decisions made: [any agreements or commitments]
- Objections raised: [any concerns expressed]
- Next steps agreed: [what was agreed to happen next]
- Personal detail: [any personal connection or non-business topic discussed]

Email should include:
1. Brief, warm opening (reference something specific from the conversation)
2. Clear summary of what was discussed (3-4 bullet points max)
3. Action items with owners and suggested dates
4. One value-add (relevant resource, case study, or insight that extends the conversation)
5. Clear CTA for the next step
6. Professional but not stiff sign-off

Length: Under 200 words. Busy executives should be able to scan it in 30 seconds.
```

**Prompt 2: "Gone Dark" Re-engagement Sequence**
```
A deal has gone quiet. Help me re-engage without being annoying.

Deal context:
- Prospect: [Name], [Title] at [Company]
- Last contact: [date] ([what happened - e.g., "They said they'd get back to us after internal review"])
- Days since last contact: [X]
- Deal stage when they went quiet: [stage]
- What they cared about most: [their primary pain point / interest]
- Our champion (if any): [who was most engaged]
- Known competitors in evaluation: [if any]

Generate a 3-email re-engagement sequence:

Email 1 (send now): Gentle, value-first re-engagement
- Don't say "just checking in" or "circling back"
- Lead with something of value (relevant news, case study, product update)
- Make responding easy (yes/no question or simple CTA)

Email 2 (send in 5 days if no response): Different angle
- Try a different trigger or value proposition
- Be shorter than email 1
- Create mild urgency without being pushy

Email 3 (send in 7 more days if still no response): Direct "close the loop"
- Be honest: "I want to respect your time"
- Give them an easy out
- Include a soft close option

Also suggest: Alternative channels to try alongside email (LinkedIn message, phone call timing).
```

**Prompt 3: Multi-Stakeholder Follow-up Strategy**
```
I had a meeting with multiple stakeholders. Help me write targeted follow-up emails for each person.

Meeting attendees:
1. [Name], [Title] - [Their role in the buying decision, e.g., "Economic buyer, focused on ROI"]
2. [Name], [Title] - [Their role, e.g., "Technical evaluator, concerned about integration"]
3. [Name], [Title] - [Their role, e.g., "End user, excited about specific feature"]

Meeting summary:
[Brief overview of what was discussed]

Key points each person cared about:
1. [Person 1's priorities]
2. [Person 2's priorities]
3. [Person 3's priorities]

For each stakeholder, generate a personalized follow-up email that:
- References their specific concerns and interests
- Provides a relevant resource tailored to their role (ROI calculator for buyer, technical docs for evaluator, user guide for end user)
- Asks a role-appropriate question to keep them engaged
- Suggests a specific next step relevant to their evaluation criteria

Each email should feel like it was written individually, not like 3 versions of the same template.
```
