**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: Finance analyst staring at a variance report, then cutting to a tense management meeting with a CFO being asked "so why did marketing overspend?" and the analyst looking uncertain.
[Voiceover]: "Your budget variance report says what happened. But when the CEO asks why — do you actually know?"

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Stacks of spreadsheets, emails going back and forth between finance and department heads, a slide deck with vague bullet points like "timing shift" and "market conditions."
[Voiceover]: "67% of FP&A teams say explaining budget variances is their most time-consuming monthly task. And 58% aren't confident their explanations capture the real root cause — just the surface excuse that came back from the department."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: User pastes variance data into COCO. COCO instantly decomposes a marketing overrun into rate variance, volume variance, and channel mix shift — each quantified. A clean management narrative appears.
