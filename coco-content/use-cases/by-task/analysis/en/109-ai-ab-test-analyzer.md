## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Teams run underpowered tests and call winners too early; 35% of "winning" variants are actually noise**

Teams run underpowered tests and call winners too early; 35% of "winning" variants are actually noise. This isn't just an inconvenience — it's a measurable drag on the business. Teams that face this challenge report spending an average of 15-30 hours per week on manual workarounds that could be automated.

The real cost goes beyond the immediate time waste. When growth pms are stuck in reactive mode, strategic work doesn't happen. Opportunities are missed. Competitors who have solved this problem move faster, ship sooner, and serve customers better.

Most teams have tried to address this with a combination of spreadsheets, manual processes, and good intentions. The problem is that these approaches don't scale. What works for 10 items breaks at 100. What works for 100 collapses at 1,000. And in today's environment, you're dealing with thousands.

**How COCO Solves It**

1. **Calculates optimal sample sizes**: Calculates optimal sample sizes and test duration before launch. COCO handles this end-to-end, requiring minimal configuration and zero ongoing maintenance. The system learns from your specific patterns and improves over time.

2. **Monitors test health: sample**: Monitors test health: sample ratio mismatch, novelty effects, and Simpson's paradox. COCO handles this end-to-end, requiring minimal configuration and zero ongoing maintenance. The system learns from your specific patterns and improves over time.

3. **Provides Bayesian and frequentist**: Provides Bayesian and frequentist analysis with clear business recommendations. COCO handles this end-to-end, requiring minimal configuration and zero ongoing maintenance. The system learns from your specific patterns and improves over time.

**Measurable Results**

- **Test Accuracy**: 65% → 94%
- **Test Velocity**: 3/month → 12/month
- **Revenue Impact**: +$340K/year
- **Team satisfaction**: Significant improvement reported
- **Time to value**: Results visible within first week
- **ROI payback**: Typically under 30 days
