**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: A PM's calendar showing back-to-back alignment meetings all week; their actual product work shows zero time
[Voiceover]: "You became a PM to build products. Why are you spending half your week managing politics?"

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: A product launch meeting where a VP says "we never agreed to that scope" — everyone around the table looking uncomfortable
[Voiceover]: "Enterprise PMs spend 47% of their time on internal alignment — and still face launch-blocking stakeholder conflicts at the last minute. The problem isn't the meetings. It's that alignment isn't a meeting — it's a continuous process most PMs don't have a system for."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: COCO generating a stakeholder map with influence levels, then auto-creating tailored executive briefings for three different audiences from a single input
[Voiceover]: "COCO maps every stakeholder's decision authority and what they actually care about — then generates tailored communications for each of them automatically. One source of truth. Five different stakeholder-specific messages. Alignment tracked in real-time, with early warnings when someone starts drifting."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: A PM presenting in an executive meeting with full confidence; a calendar with 1.5 days freed up
[Voiceover]: "41% fewer launch-blocking conflicts. 1.5 days per week back for actual product work. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
