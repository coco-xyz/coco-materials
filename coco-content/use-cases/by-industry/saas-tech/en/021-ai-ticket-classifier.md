## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Manual Ticket Triage Is a Bottleneck That Gets Worse at Scale**

Every support organization faces the triage bottleneck. Incoming tickets arrive through multiple channels (email, chat, web forms, social media, phone) in unstructured natural language. Someone has to read each one, understand the issue, assign a priority, categorize it, and route it to the right team. At 100 tickets/day, a skilled support lead can handle this. At 500/day, it becomes a full-time job. At 1,000+/day, it's impossible for one person and you're hiring triage-only headcount.

The human cost of misrouting is significant. When a ticket goes to the wrong team, the customer waits while it's reassigned. Average reassignment adds 2-4 hours to resolution time. And the customer has to re-explain their issue to a new agent, creating frustration. In high-volume environments, misrouting rates of 20-40% are common.

Priority assignment is equally problematic. A customer reporting a production outage and a customer asking about a feature request both arrive as "new tickets." Without intelligent prioritization, they wait in the same queue, and SLA breaches become inevitable.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Ticket Classifier provides instant, accurate triage for every incoming support ticket.

1. **Natural Language Understanding**: COCO reads the full ticket content and understands:
   - The type of issue (bug, feature request, billing, how-to, account access, integration, etc.)
   - The severity (production down, degraded performance, inconvenience, question)
   - The product area affected
   - The customer's emotional state (frustrated, confused, angry, neutral)
   - Whether the ticket contains enough information to diagnose (or needs clarification)

2. **Multi-Factor Priority Assignment**: Priority isn't just about what the customer says -- it's about context:
   - **Issue severity**: Production outage = P1, Feature request = P4
   - **Customer tier**: Enterprise/VIP customer = priority boost
   - **Business impact**: Revenue-affecting issues get higher priority
   - **Sentiment analysis**: Frustrated/angry customers get elevated attention
   - **SLA context**: Tickets approaching SLA breach get auto-escalated
   - **Repeat tickets**: Same customer, same issue = escalation

3. **Intelligent Routing**: Based on classification, COCO routes to the correct team:
   - Maps issues to specialized teams (billing, technical, product, security)
   - Considers agent availability, workload, and expertise
   - Routes complex issues to senior agents directly
   - Handles multi-issue tickets by splitting or routing to primary team with secondary tag

4. **Auto-Response for Common Issues**: For tickets that match known solutions, COCO:
   - Identifies relevant knowledge base articles
   - Generates a helpful auto-response with the specific solution steps
   - Sets ticket to "Awaiting Customer Confirmation" instead of closing
   - If the customer replies saying it didn't work, auto-escalates to human agent

5. **Escalation Intelligence**: COCO detects escalation triggers:
   - Customer mentions "cancel," "legal," "regulator," or "executive"
   - Customer has submitted 3+ tickets on the same issue
   - SLA breach is imminent
   - VIP customer with any P2+ issue
   - Negative sentiment exceeding threshold

6. **Continuous Learning**: Classification accuracy improves over time:
   - Learns from agent corrections (when an agent reclassifies a ticket)
   - Adapts to new issue types as products evolve
   - Updates routing rules based on resolution patterns

**Measurable Results**

- **Misrouting rate**: From 31% to 4% (87% reduction)
- **First-response time**: From 4.7 hours to 47 minutes (83% reduction)
- **Auto-resolved tickets**: 35% of volume handled without human agent
- **CSAT score**: From 72% to 89%
- **Triage labor saved**: 3+ hours/day of team lead time
- **SLA breach rate**: From 18% to 3%
- **Average resolution time**: Reduced by 42%

**Who Benefits**

- **Support Agents**: Receive properly categorized, prioritized tickets in their specialty area
- **Support Managers**: Eliminate triage bottleneck; focus on quality and coaching
- **Customers**: Faster, more accurate first responses; fewer "wrong department" bounces
- **Operations**: Clean ticket data for reporting, capacity planning, and product feedback loops

## Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Build Ticket Classification Taxonomy**
```
Help me build a ticket classification taxonomy for our support team.

Our product: [describe your product]
Support channels: [email, chat, phone, web form]
Current team structure: [list specialist teams, e.g., billing, technical, product]
Common issue types we see: [list the types of issues you get most often]
SLA tiers: [list your SLA requirements by priority level]

Create:
1. Category taxonomy (3 levels: Category > Subcategory > Issue Type) with at least 30 issue types
2. Priority matrix mapping issue types to priority levels (P1-P4)
3. Routing rules: which team handles which categories
4. Auto-escalation triggers: conditions that should automatically escalate a ticket
5. Auto-response candidates: issue types where a KB article can fully resolve the question
6. Sentiment-based overrides: when sentiment should change priority regardless of issue type
```

**Prompt 2: Classify a Batch of Tickets**
```
Classify these support tickets. For each, provide: category, subcategory, priority (P1-P4), recommended team, sentiment score, and whether it can be auto-resolved with a KB article.

Our classification taxonomy:
[paste your taxonomy or describe categories]

Our priority definitions:
- P1: Production down, security breach, data loss
- P2: Major feature broken, significant business impact
- P3: Minor issue, workaround available
- P4: Question, feature request, minor cosmetic issue

Tickets:

Ticket #1: "[paste ticket subject and body]"
Ticket #2: "[paste ticket subject and body]"
Ticket #3: "[paste ticket subject and body]"
[...continue]

For each ticket, output:
| Ticket | Category | Subcategory | Priority | Team | Sentiment | Auto-resolve? | Reasoning |
```

**Prompt 3: Write Auto-Response Templates**
```
Create auto-response templates for our top 10 most common ticket types. Each response should feel helpful and human, not robotic.

Our top 10 ticket types:
1. [Issue type] - [brief description of what customers ask]
2. [Issue type] - [brief description]
[...continue for all 10]

Our brand voice: [describe - e.g., "friendly, professional, empathetic"]
Our product name: [name]

For each ticket type, write:
1. An empathetic opening (acknowledges their issue)
2. Step-by-step solution (clear, numbered steps)
3. Link placeholder for relevant KB article: [KB: article-name]
4. Fallback: "If this doesn't resolve your issue, reply to this email and a team member will assist you within [SLA timeframe]"
5. Warm sign-off

Keep each response under 150 words. Test readability: would a frustrated customer find this helpful, not annoying?
