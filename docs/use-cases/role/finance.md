# Finance Use Cases

AI employees for finance teams, FP&A, and accounts payable.

## AI Expense Auditor
**Pain:** 200 expense reports/month. 20 minutes each to check receipts and policy rules. 66 hours/month.
**Solution:** AI reviews every report instantly, auto-approves compliant ones, flags violations with exact rule broken.
**Result:** 66h/month → 2h (flagged items only). Zero missed violations.

## AI Financial Report Generator
**Pain:** Monthly reports = 2 days pulling data from 6 systems, fixing formatting, chasing discrepancies.
**Solution:** AI pulls data from multiple sources, reconciles, flags discrepancies, generates formatted reports.
**Result:** 2 days → 3 hours. Board-ready with every number sourced and traceable.

## AI Invoice Processor

**Solution:** AI extracts data, matches to POs, verifies amounts, routes for approval in 30 seconds.
**Result:** 15min/invoice → 30 seconds. 30x more volume without adding headcount.
