**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: Recruiter losing a strong candidate to a competitor — candidate texting "sorry, accepted another offer, it was higher"
[Voiceover]: "You lost a great candidate because your salary range was 18 months out of date."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Total Rewards analyst buried in survey export spreadsheets, pay equity spreadsheet with unexplained gaps highlighted, pay transparency law requirements on screen
[Voiceover]: "Compensation benchmarking is complex, time-consuming, and expensive to get wrong. Stale data loses candidates. Internal pay gaps create legal and retention risk. And pay transparency laws are coming whether you're ready or not."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: HR feeding market data into COCO, percentile positioning and range recommendations appearing, pay equity flags surfacing, compliance guidance generating
[Voiceover]: "Feed COCO your market data and internal pay data. Get benchmarking analysis, internal equity gaps, pay range recommendations, and pay transparency compliance guidance — in days, not weeks."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: Recruiter making a competitive offer with confidence, compensation committee approving a clear range structure, employees reading total rewards statements
[Voiceover]: "31% fewer rejected offers. 60% faster compliance prep. Pay you can defend. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
