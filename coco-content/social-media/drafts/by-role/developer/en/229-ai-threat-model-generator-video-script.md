# Video Script: AI Threat Model Generator
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "Threat modeling is universally acknowledged as a best practice — and universally underpracticed. Security teams are chronically understaffed, supporting 10-20x more developers than they can meaningfully engage. The result: security review happens at the wrong time — penetration testing against a system already in production, rather than catching design flaws at design time."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows a whiteboard photo and informal notes as the only security documentation for a shipped system, right side shows an information disclosure flaw discovered during a breach investigation. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "55% of critical security findings from penetration tests are predictable from threat model analysis. An information disclosure threat caught in design costs a developer 4 hours to fix. The same design flaw discovered during a breach investigation costs orders of magnitude more — plus regulatory and reputational consequences."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Architecture-based threat identification analyzing all data entry points, trust boundary crossings, and external entities to apply STRIDE methodology systematically — not from a generic checklist
  - DREAD risk scoring prioritizing threats by Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, and Discoverability — adjusted for system context (a healthcare system vs. an internal dashboard)
  - Specific technical mitigations per threat with implementation guidance, OWASP/NIST references, and verifiable security acceptance criteria
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Threat Model Generator lets engineering teams complete an initial threat model in 3-4 hours — identifying 3-4x more threats than unstructured security reviews, without requiring an in-house security architect."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "Teams with systematic threat models remediate 70% of high-priority threats before launch vs. 30% without. Quarterly reviews catch 80% of new attack surfaces introduced by features. Threat model documentation satisfies STRIDE evidence requirements for ISO 27001, SOC 2, and HIPAA — security built in, not bolted on."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
