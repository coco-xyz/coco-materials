# Use Case #102: AI Customer Health Scorer

**Role**: Support | **Industry**: SaaS | **Task**: Customer Health Scoring

## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Churn Is a Surprise Because Customer Health Scoring Is Broken**

In the SaaS industry, customer churn is the silent revenue killer -- and the most frustrating aspect is that 67% of churn comes as a complete surprise to the Customer Success team. The customer seemed fine, engagement looked normal, and then suddenly they are gone. The problem is not that the warning signs did not exist; it is that traditional health scoring systems are too simplistic and too slow to detect them.

Most customer health scores today rely on 3 to 5 signals at most: login frequency, support ticket volume, NPS survey responses, contract renewal date proximity, and perhaps a CSM's subjective assessment. These signals capture less than 15% of the information that actually predicts churn. A customer can be logging in every day (to extract their data before leaving), have zero support tickets (because they have given up on getting help), and even give a decent NPS score (because the respondent is not the decision-maker considering cancellation).

Manual scoring compounds the problem. When CSMs are responsible for manually assessing each account's health monthly -- which takes an average of 2 hours per account -- they are relying on gut feel informed by their most recent interaction rather than a comprehensive data analysis. With portfolios of 40-80 accounts, a CSM simply cannot maintain a deep, data-driven understanding of every customer's trajectory. The accounts that get attention are the ones that complain loudly, not necessarily the ones that are quietly drifting toward cancellation.

The early warning gap is perhaps the most costly failure. By the time traditional health scores flag a customer as at-risk, the window for effective intervention has often closed. A customer who has already completed their competitive evaluation, gained internal consensus to switch, and begun data migration planning is not going to be saved by a check-in call from their CSM. Studies show that the average window between a customer making the mental decision to churn and formally notifying the vendor is 45-90 days -- but most health scores only flag the risk 7-14 days before renewal, when it is far too late.

The lack of actionable intelligence is the final gap. Even when an account is correctly identified as at-risk, most health scoring systems provide no guidance on why the customer is at risk or what specific action would be most likely to save the account. CSMs are left to guess, often defaulting to the same playbook (schedule a QBR, offer a discount, involve an executive) regardless of the actual issue. This one-size-fits-all intervention approach has a success rate below 20%.

The financial impact is staggering. For a SaaS company with $50M ARR and 15% annual gross churn, each percentage point of churn improvement represents $500K in preserved revenue -- recurring, compounding, year after year. The math makes sophisticated health scoring one of the highest-ROI investments a SaaS company can make.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Customer Health Scorer replaces simplistic, manual health assessment with a comprehensive, predictive system that catches churn risk early and prescribes specific interventions.

1. **Multi-Signal Collection and Analysis**: COCO ingests and correlates dozens of health signals across every customer touchpoint: product usage depth and breadth (not just logins, but feature adoption, workflow completion, and value realization metrics), support interaction patterns (sentiment analysis of tickets, escalation frequency, resolution satisfaction), engagement signals (email open rates, event attendance, community participation, content consumption), financial signals (payment timeliness, expansion conversations, pricing sensitivity), and relationship signals (stakeholder changes, champion departures, executive sponsor engagement). Each signal is weighted by its historical correlation with churn for customers in similar segments.

2. **Predictive Health Scoring**: Using machine learning models trained on your historical customer data, COCO generates a continuously-updated health score that predicts churn probability 60-90 days in advance. The score is not a simple average of inputs -- it is a sophisticated model that understands non-linear relationships (e.g., a small drop in feature adoption combined with a support sentiment decline is more predictive than either signal alone) and accounts for segment-specific patterns (enterprise customers show different pre-churn patterns than SMB).

3. **Trend Analysis and Trajectory Detection**: Beyond a point-in-time score, COCO tracks health trajectories. A customer at 75 health who was at 90 three months ago is in a very different situation than one at 75 who was at 60 three months ago. COCO identifies acceleration and deceleration patterns, inflection points where health begins declining, and recovery patterns that signal a save attempt is working. This trajectory view is often more actionable than the absolute score.

4. **Intelligent Alert Triggering**: Rather than simply displaying scores on a dashboard, COCO proactively alerts CSMs when intervention is needed. Alerts are prioritized by urgency (how quickly the health is declining), value (ARR at risk), and actionability (can something actually be done at this stage). Each alert includes the specific signals driving the risk, eliminating the "why is this customer flagged?" question.

5. **Prescriptive Action Recommendations**: For each at-risk customer, COCO recommends specific intervention actions based on what has worked for similar customers in similar situations. If the churn risk is driven by low feature adoption, the recommendation might be a targeted training session on the underutilized features. If driven by stakeholder change, it might recommend an executive alignment meeting. Recommendations are ranked by predicted effectiveness and effort required.

6. **Score Calibration and Learning**: COCO continuously evaluates its own accuracy. When a customer it scored as healthy churns (a miss), it investigates what signals it should have weighted more heavily. When an at-risk customer is successfully saved, it learns which intervention was most effective. The system's predictive accuracy improves with every quarter of data, and it adapts to changes in your product, market, and customer base.

**Who Benefits**

- **Customer Success Managers**: Know exactly which accounts need attention and what action to take
- **CS Leadership**: Manage team capacity based on portfolio risk distribution, not just account count
- **Revenue Leadership**: Forecast retention with confidence and invest in interventions with measurable ROI

- Average save rate (current): [X]%
- Target save rate: [X]%
- Resources available: CSM, CS leadership, product team, executive sponsor program, professional services
- Budget for saves: [discount authority, free services, etc.]

For each of the following churn scenarios, create a detailed save playbook:

**Scenario 1: Low Adoption** (customer paying but barely using the product)
**Scenario 2: Champion Departure** (key internal advocate left the company)
**Scenario 3: Competitive Threat** (customer is actively evaluating alternatives)
**Scenario 4: Budget Pressure** (customer wants to reduce spend)
**Scenario 5: Poor Experience** (customer has had support/product issues eroding trust)

For each scenario, provide:

2. **Root Cause Investigation**: Questions to ask and data to analyze to understand the specific situation

3. **Intervention Timeline**: Day-by-day action plan for the first 14 days after identification:
   - Day 1-2: Immediate actions
   - Day 3-7: Investigation and strategy
   - Day 8-14: Execution of save plan

4. **Communication Templates**:
   - CSM outreach email/message
   - Executive sponsor engagement email
   - Renewal conversation talk track

5. **Offer Framework**: What we can offer to address the situation:
   - Non-monetary interventions (training, consulting, product workarounds)
   - Monetary interventions (discount, extended terms, reduced scope) with approval requirements
   - Product commitments (timeline for fixes/features, beta access)
   - Rules of engagement (what NOT to offer)

6. **Success Metrics**: How to measure if the save is working
   - Leading indicators (within 2 weeks)
   - Lagging indicators (within 60 days)
   - Definition of "saved" vs. "deferred churn"
