# Video Script: AI Competitive Battlecard Builder
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "Your sales rep walks into a competitive deal and pulls up the battlecard from last spring. It references the competitor's pricing that changed in Q2, a feature gap they filled in September, and a weakness they addressed eight weeks ago. The rep either presents outdated information with confidence — or admits the battlecard might be stale. Either way, the deal suffers."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows a rep with an outdated battlecard against a sharp competitor, right side shows the research hours multiplying across 6-10 active competitors and quarterly refreshes. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "A thorough battlecard for one competitor takes 8 to 12 hours of initial research — multiplied by 6 to 10 active competitors plus quarterly refresh cycles. Competitive intelligence becomes a full-time job most teams can't staff. So battlecards are good at launch and get progressively worse."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Multi-source intelligence aggregation synthesizing G2/Capterra reviews, win/loss notes, CRM call transcripts, and product release announcements into a single unified battlecard
  - Differentiated strength analysis distinguishing perceived advantages (what their marketing says) from experienced advantages (what customers confirm in reviews) — down to segment level
  - Objection handling script generation producing complete response scripts for the top 5-8 competitive objections: reframe, respond, evidence, follow-up question
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Competitive Battlecard Builder cuts per-competitor creation time from 8-12 hours to 2-3 hours, and quarterly refresh from 4 hours to under 1. Always current, always specific."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "Sales rep confidence in competitive encounters up 40%. Win rates in head-to-head competitive situations improve 10-18%. Correct objection handling jumps from 45% to 78% of reps — because outdated battlecards aren't just unhelpful, they're actively costing you deals."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
