**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: Marketing manager surrounded by 8 browser tabs — Google Ads, LinkedIn, HubSpot, Salesforce, GA4, all open simultaneously. Overwhelmed expression.
[Voiceover]: "You have data from 8 platforms and zero idea which campaign is actually working."

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Pie chart of marketing manager's week — 12 hours on copy-pasting numbers, 2 hours on actual strategy. Leadership slide showing "Impressions: 42,000" with no context or recommendation.
[Voiceover]: "The average marketing manager spends 12 hours a week just collecting data from different platforms. Reports show numbers — not insights. 67% of marketing leaders say they don't fully trust their own performance data. And bad campaigns run for weeks before anyone notices."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: COCO ingesting data from all connected platforms. Unified dashboard showing channels side-by-side. Plain-language alert: "LinkedIn IT segment 31% below CPL target — recommend pausing and reallocating to Finance segment."
[Voiceover]: "COCO pulls data from every platform, normalizes it, and tells you what it means — in plain English. Real-time anomaly alerts catch wasted spend in 24 hours, not at the weekly review. Reports come with recommendations, not just numbers."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: Clean one-page executive report. Budget waste reduction counter. Marketing manager presenting confidently to CFO.
[Voiceover]: "2 hours of analysis instead of 12. 28% less wasted ad spend. Reports your CFO actually trusts. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
