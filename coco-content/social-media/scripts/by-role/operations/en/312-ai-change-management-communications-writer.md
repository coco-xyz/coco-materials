# #312 - AI Change Management Communications Writer — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Operations / Content
**Metric**: 72% of change programs fail due to poor communication → 3x higher adoption

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: System migration launch day. Employees are confused, managers have no answers, Slack fills with frustrated messages. Adoption is at 30%.
[Voiceover]: "Your new system is live. Nobody knows how to use it. And nobody is happy about it."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Single generic all-staff email about a major change. One town hall. No manager talking points. Resistance builds visibly — hallway conversations, pushback in meetings, workarounds proliferating.
[Voiceover]: "72% of change initiatives fail because of poor communication. People need to hear a message 7 times. They need it from their manager, not just an email from HR. And they need to know what it means for their specific role — not just the organization."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: Operations manager using COCO to generate a full 3-month communication plan, audience-specific versions of each message, a manager conversation guide, a resistance response toolkit, and a town hall script. Each output is polished and ready to use.
[Voiceover]: "Tell COCO your change, your affected audiences, and their likely concerns. COCO builds the full communications toolkit — multi-channel plan, audience-specific messages, manager conversation guides, resistance responses, and town hall scripts — in hours."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: Adoption dashboard showing 85% system adoption at 30 days. Employees confidently using the new system. Manager having a calm, informed team conversation.
[Voiceover]: "3x higher adoption. Teams that actually embrace change instead of fighting it — try COCO at coco.xyz"
