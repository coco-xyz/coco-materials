# Video Script: AI PRD Generator
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "A PM's most irreplaceable contribution is judgment — deciding what to build and why. But for teams running two-week sprints, writing a single PRD takes 6 to 10 hours. That's one-third of every sprint cycle consumed by documentation instead of actual product thinking."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows a PM buried in a blank doc with engineering waiting, right side shows mid-sprint rework triggered by ambiguous acceptance criteria. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "PRDs written under pressure are incomplete. Engineers ask clarifying questions that delay sprint start. Every ambiguity costs 30 to 60 minutes of meeting time to resolve — mid-sprint, when changing course is expensive. Roughly 30% of sprints are delayed by incomplete specs."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Context-to-structure conversion turning rough notes, bullet points, and meeting transcripts into a complete PRD with all standard sections
  - User story generation with primary flows and edge-case stories linked to research evidence
  - Specific, testable acceptance criteria written in Given/When/Then format — directly usable by QA without interpretation
Voiceover: "COCO's AI PRD Generator transforms raw input into a complete, structured PRD draft in 60-90 minutes. 40% better coverage than manually written PRDs. Ready for Confluence or Notion without reformatting."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "PRD drafting time cut 80-85%. Clarifying questions from engineering drop by ~50%. Sprint kickoff delays from incomplete specs fall from 30% of sprints to under 10% — and PMs recover 4-6 hours per sprint for research, strategy, and user conversations."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
