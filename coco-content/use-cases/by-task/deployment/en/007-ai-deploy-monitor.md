## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Deployments Are Your Biggest Source of Incidents**

Research from DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) consistently shows that deployments are the single largest source of production incidents. The irony: the faster you ship (which every business demands), the more incidents you create. Most teams respond by either slowing down deployments (hurting velocity) or accepting a higher incident rate (hurting reliability).

The core problem isn't the deployment itself -- it's the detection and response gap. On average, it takes 15-45 minutes to detect a deployment-caused regression, another 10-30 minutes to diagnose the root cause, and 5-15 minutes to execute a rollback. During that window, users are suffering, revenue is lost, and trust erodes.

Existing monitoring tools are powerful but passive. They collect data and fire alerts based on static thresholds. They don't understand that a latency spike starting exactly 3 minutes after a deploy is probably caused by that deploy. That correlation -- obvious to a human looking at the timeline -- requires manual investigation every single time.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI Deploy Monitor acts as an intelligent layer on top of your existing monitoring infrastructure (Datadog, Prometheus/Grafana, CloudWatch, New Relic, etc.). It doesn't replace your tools -- it makes them proactive.

1. **Deploy-Aware Monitoring**: COCO hooks into your CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, ArgoCD). When a deployment starts, COCO automatically enters heightened monitoring mode, capturing baseline metrics from the pre-deploy window and watching for deviations.

2. **Multi-Signal Anomaly Detection**: COCO monitors signals across multiple dimensions simultaneously:
   - Application: Error rates, latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99), throughput
   - Infrastructure: CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, container restarts
   - Business: Transaction completion rates, cart abandonment, API success rates
   - Dependencies: Database query times, cache hit rates, external API latencies

3. **Causal Correlation**: When an anomaly is detected, COCO doesn't just alert -- it correlates the anomaly with the specific changes in the deployment. It analyzes the diff, identifies which services were modified, and maps the anomaly to the most likely root cause.

4. **Automated Response Tiers**:
   - **Tier 1 (Warning)**: Subtle anomaly detected. Notify the team with analysis. No action taken.
   - **Tier 2 (Auto-Pause)**: Significant regression detected. Pause canary rollout. Wait for human decision.
   - **Tier 3 (Auto-Rollback)**: Critical regression (error rate > threshold, latency > SLA). Automatically roll back and notify.

5. **Post-Deploy Analysis**: After every deployment (successful or not), COCO generates a deploy health report:
   - Before/after metric comparisons
   - Anomalies detected and their resolution
   - Performance regression trends over time
   - Recommendations for improving deployment safety

6. **Incident Timeline Construction**: When things go wrong, COCO automatically constructs a detailed incident timeline: what was deployed, when metrics diverged, which users were affected, what the root cause was, and what actions were taken. This eliminates hours of post-incident investigation.

**Measurable Results**

- **Mean time to detection (MTTD)**: Reduced from 23 minutes to 94 seconds
- **Mean time to rollback (MTTR)**: Reduced from 15 minutes to under 3 minutes
- **Customer-facing incidents from deploys**: Reduced by 91%
- **On-call engineer alert fatigue**: Reduced by 65% (fewer false alarms)
- **Post-incident review preparation time**: Reduced from 4 hours to 30 minutes

**Who Benefits**

- **SRE/DevOps Teams**: Sleep better. Fewer pages. Faster incident resolution.
- **On-Call Engineers**: Clear root cause analysis instead of manual investigation at 3 AM
- **Engineering Managers**: Ship faster without increasing incident rate
- **Business Stakeholders**: Higher uptime, fewer customer complaints, protected revenue

## Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Post-Deploy Health Check Analysis**
```
Analyze the following deployment metrics and determine if this deploy is healthy or needs rollback.

Deploy timestamp: [time]
Service: [service name]
Changes: [brief description of what was deployed]

Pre-deploy baseline (last 30 min):
- Error rate: [X]%
- p99 latency: [X]ms
- CPU utilization: [X]%
- Memory: [X]%
- Requests/sec: [X]

Post-deploy (last 15 min):
- Error rate: [X]%
- p99 latency: [X]ms
- CPU utilization: [X]%
- Memory: [X]%
- Requests/sec: [X]

Error log sample:
[paste recent error logs]

Provide: health verdict, risk assessment, root cause hypothesis if unhealthy, and recommended action (proceed/monitor/rollback).
```

**Prompt 2: Incident Root Cause Analysis**
```
An incident occurred after deployment. Help me construct a root cause analysis.

Timeline:
- Deploy started: [time]
- Deploy completed: [time]
- First anomaly detected: [time]
- Alert fired: [time]
- Rollback initiated: [time]
- Recovery confirmed: [time]

Deployment changes (diff summary):
[paste key changes]

Affected metrics:
[paste metric data or screenshots description]

Error samples:
[paste representative errors]

Generate a structured RCA including:
1. Incident summary (what happened, impact, duration)
2. Root cause (what specifically caused the issue)
3. Contributing factors (what made it worse)
4. Timeline analysis (where we lost time)
5. Action items (prevent recurrence, improve detection, reduce blast radius)
```

**Prompt 3: Deployment Runbook Generation**
```
Generate a deployment runbook for our [service name] based on:

Architecture: [describe service architecture]
Dependencies: [list downstream/upstream services]
Database migrations: [yes/no, describe if yes]
Feature flags: [list any feature flags being toggled]
Expected traffic: [current requests/sec]
Deploy strategy: [rolling/blue-green/canary with X% increments]

Include:
1. Pre-deploy checklist (what to verify before deploying)
2. Key metrics to monitor during rollout (with specific thresholds)
3. Smoke test commands to run after deploy
4. Rollback procedure (step-by-step)
5. Communication plan (who to notify, when)
6. Known risks and mitigations
```

**Prompt 4: Alert Threshold Optimization**
```
Our current alerting generates too many false positives. Help optimize thresholds.

Service: [service name]
Current alerts and their thresholds:
[list each alert with current threshold]

Last 30 days alert history:
- Total alerts fired: [X]
- True positives (actual incidents): [X]
- False positives: [X]
- Alerts during deploys: [X]

Normal traffic patterns:
- Peak hours: [times]
- Off-peak baseline: [metrics]
- Known spikes: [e.g., batch jobs at midnight]

Recommend new thresholds that reduce false positives by at least 50% while maintaining detection of real incidents. Consider dynamic thresholds based on time of day.
