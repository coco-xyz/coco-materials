## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: User testing sessions cost $5K each and take 3 weeks to schedule; teams ship features without validation**

User testing sessions cost $5K each and take 3 weeks to schedule; teams ship features without validation. This isn't just an inconvenience — it's a measurable drag on the business. Teams that face this challenge report spending an average of 15-30 hours per week on manual workarounds that could be automated.

The real cost goes beyond the immediate time waste. When ux researchers are stuck in reactive mode, strategic work doesn't happen. Opportunities are missed. Competitors who have solved this problem move faster, ship sooner, and serve customers better.

Most teams have tried to address this with a combination of spreadsheets, manual processes, and good intentions. The problem is that these approaches don't scale. What works for 10 items breaks at 100. What works for 100 collapses at 1,000. And in today's environment, you're dealing with thousands.

**How COCO Solves It**

1. **Analyzes session recordings to**: Analyzes session recordings to identify rage clicks, dead clicks, and confusion patterns. COCO handles this end-to-end, requiring minimal configuration and zero ongoing maintenance. The system learns from your specific patterns and improves over time.

2. **Generates heatmaps and user**: Generates heatmaps and user flow analysis without manual review. COCO handles this end-to-end, requiring minimal configuration and zero ongoing maintenance. The system learns from your specific patterns and improves over time.

3. **Suggests specific UI improvements**: Suggests specific UI improvements with predicted impact on conversion. COCO handles this end-to-end, requiring minimal configuration and zero ongoing maintenance. The system learns from your specific patterns and improves over time.
