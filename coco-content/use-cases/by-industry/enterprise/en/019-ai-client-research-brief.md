## Social Media Copy

I walked into a meeting with a Fortune 500 CIO last year. Prepared for 2 hours. Felt ready. Then she mentioned their board had just approved a $40M digital transformation initiative -- announced in an earnings call 3 days earlier that I hadn't listened to. Her face when I asked "what digital transformation?" told me everything. The meeting was effectively over.

Never again. But the research problem is real: a thorough executive meeting prep used to take 2-3 hours per meeting. Earnings calls, 10-K filings, LinkedIn activity, press releases, industry reports, Glassdoor for internal culture signals, patent filings, job postings for strategic direction. My calendar had 4-6 client meetings per week. That's 12-18 hours on research alone.

COCO's AI Client Research Brief now gives me what used to take 3 hours in 8 minutes:
- Pulls the latest company financials, press coverage, executive changes, and strategic initiatives
- Cross-references with industry trends and competitive landscape
- Generates a one-page executive brief: key talking points, potential pain points, landmines to avoid, and recommended conversation openers
- Flags changes since my last meeting with this client

I haven't walked into an unprepared meeting since. Close rate on executive-level meetings: up 35%. Because the best sales advantage is simply knowing more than the other vendor.

## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Inadequate Meeting Prep Costs More Than You Realize**

Executive-level sales meetings are the highest-leverage activities in an AE's week. A single well-run meeting with a decision-maker can advance a deal more than a month of lower-level conversations. But these meetings have an unforgiving cost of failure: show up unprepared, and you don't get a second chance.

Adequate preparation for an executive meeting requires understanding the company's financial performance, strategic priorities, recent organizational changes, competitive threats, industry trends, and the specific executive's background and communication style. This research spans multiple sources: SEC filings, earnings call transcripts, press releases, LinkedIn, industry publications, Glassdoor, patent databases, and job posting patterns.

Most AEs cut corners on research not out of laziness, but out of time constraints. With 4-6 meetings per week and deals to progress, spending 3 hours per meeting on research is unsustainable. The result: AEs walk into meetings with surface-level knowledge, miss critical context, and fail to connect their solution to the client's actual strategic priorities.
