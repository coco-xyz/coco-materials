# #283 - AI LinkedIn Thought Leadership Writer — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Marketing / Content Creation
**Metric**: 1-2 posts/month → 3-5 posts/week with 4x more comments

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: Executive staring at a blank LinkedIn draft, cursor blinking. Clock shows 45 minutes have passed.
[Voiceover]: "Your best business insights are locked in your head — and LinkedIn's algorithm is punishing you for it."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Email thread bouncing between marketing and executive — 12 messages, 5 days, still no published post. Analytics dashboard showing flat follower growth and single-digit engagement.
[Voiceover]: "76% of executives say they don't post because they don't know what to write. The average marketing-to-exec content loop takes 5 business days per post — and still produces corporate-speak that nobody engages with. Meanwhile, competitors are building pipeline directly from LinkedIn every single week."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: Executive dictating rough thoughts into COCO. COCO generating 3 post variants in different voices. Marketing manager selecting and scheduling — total time: 28 minutes.
[Voiceover]: "COCO captures raw thinking in any format — voice notes, bullet points, a Slack message — builds an authentic voice profile for each executive, and generates ready-to-publish posts in under 30 minutes. No more corporate rewrites. No more 5-day approval cycles."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: Notification feed lighting up with comments and connection requests. Analytics dashboard showing follower growth curve turning sharply upward.
[Voiceover]: "4x more comments. 65% follower growth in 90 days. Pipeline that starts on LinkedIn. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
