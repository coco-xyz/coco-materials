**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: An attorney surrounded by stacked contract binders, highlighter in hand, clock on the wall showing midnight.
[Voiceover]: "Your team reviews 400 contracts a year — and every missed clause is a liability waiting to explode."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Split screen — two attorneys flagging different clauses in the same contract, a spreadsheet of inconsistent risk ratings, a news headline about a contract dispute.
[Voiceover]: "Manual contract review takes 4 hours per document, costs up to $2.5 million a year, and leaves risk exposure to individual judgment. Two attorneys reviewing the same contract agree on risk ratings only 60% of the time."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: COCO interface showing a contract being parsed, clause-by-clause risk tiers appearing in a structured table, redline suggestions auto-populating.
[Voiceover]: "Upload your contract, set your policy baseline, and COCO analyzes every clause in minutes — flagging deviations, assigning risk tiers, and drafting fallback language ready for negotiation."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: Attorney reviewing a clean one-page risk summary, smiling, sending it to the CFO. Clock shows 9 AM, not midnight.
[Voiceover]: "45 minutes. 90% risk consistency. 40% fewer escalations to outside counsel — try COCO at coco.xyz"
