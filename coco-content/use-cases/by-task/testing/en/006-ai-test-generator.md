# #6 - AI Test Generator

**Category**: Dev Team / QA Engineering
**Pain**: Nobody wants to write unit tests — devs skip them, coverage drops, bugs ship to production
**Solution**: COCO AI agent reads your source code and generates comprehensive unit tests automatically — edge cases included
**Metric**: 2 days manual test writing → 30 minutes

## Social Media Copy (English)

Your devs skip writing tests because it takes 2 days per module. Then bugs ship to production.

We hired an AI test generator. It reads source code, writes unit tests (edge cases included), and runs them — in 30 minutes.

Code coverage went from 34% to 89%.
