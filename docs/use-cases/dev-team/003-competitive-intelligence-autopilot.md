## Scenario

**Who:** A product manager or strategy lead who needs to stay on top of competitor moves.

**Problem:** Tracking competitors manually is tedious and inconsistent. Analysts check competitor websites, social media, press releases, and GitHub repos — then forget for weeks. Critical updates get missed. Reports get stale.

**Solution:** Using Zylos AI Agent, set up a scheduled task that automatically monitors competitor activity every 8 hours. The agent searches for news, compares against its existing knowledge base (700+ line tracking document), and only reports NEW developments — like a tireless analyst who never forgets.

## Demo / Walkthrough

### Step 1: Set up the scheduled task
Tell your AI: "Set up a recurring task to monitor competitors every 8 hours."

The scheduler creates a periodic task with:
- Search queries for target competitors
- Knowledge base with existing tracking data
- Lark/Slack notification on new findings

### Step 2: Agent runs automatically
Every 8 hours, the agent:
1. Searches the web for competitor news
2. Reads the existing 700+ line showcase document
3. Compares new findings against known timeline
4. Filters out duplicates — only reports incremental updates

### Step 3: You get notified
New findings are pushed to your Lark/Slack group instantly. No action required from you unless you want to dig deeper.
