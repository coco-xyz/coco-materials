# Video Script: AI Code Refactoring Advisor
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "That module. Everyone knows it needs refactoring. Nobody wants to touch it. Not because they lack skill — because one misunderstood hidden dependency could mean a 2 AM production incident. 'Refactor later' is a promise that compounds quarterly. A 2-week refactor in 2022 is a 2-month migration today."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows engineers carefully stepping around a fragile legacy module, right side shows a refactoring design session that consumed two days and produced no actionable plan. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "The wrong refactoring is often worse than no refactoring — it moves complexity instead of eliminating it, consumes weeks, and adds churn to code that was at least stable. Without a systematic, pattern-aware approach, refactoring is decided by whoever has the strongest opinion in the room."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Legacy pattern recognition classifying specific anti-patterns (God Objects, Shotgun Surgery, Feature Envy) by canonical refactoring strategy — with specific code references
  - Concrete refactoring strategies per finding: exactly what to extract, where the extracted method lives, what interface contracts should look like — with before/after structure
  - Effort and risk estimates per refactoring based on test coverage of affected code and number of callers — with a safe execution sequence
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Code Refactoring Advisor turns a blank page into a risk-rated action plan — what to fix first, what needs tests before starting, and what can run in parallel with feature development."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "Teams using COCO's recommendations report 70% fewer 'refactor that made things worse' incidents. Target modules see cyclomatic complexity drop 40-60%. Refactoring sprint planning cut from 2-day design sessions to 4 hours — because there's finally an executable roadmap instead of a debate."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
