## Detailed Introduction

**The Pain: Your Support System Can't Tell a $500K Customer from a Free Trial User**

Most support systems treat all customers equally. From a fairness perspective, this seems right. From a business perspective, it's catastrophic. When a $500K enterprise account gets the same 4-hour SLA as a $50/month subscriber, you're making an implicit statement about how much you value that relationship.

Enterprise customers don't just expect faster support -- they expect contextual support. When they contact you, they expect the agent to know their account, their history, their contract terms, and their strategic priorities. Being treated as ticket #4,527 in a faceless queue is, for many enterprise buyers, the beginning of the end.

The churn economics are stark. Losing one enterprise account can equal losing 100+ SMB accounts. And by the time a VP emails your CEO saying "we're evaluating alternatives," the damage is done -- recovery is expensive and uncertain. The support interaction that precipitated that email might have been trivially easy to handle correctly, if only someone had flagged it as important.

**How COCO Solves It**

COCO's AI VIP Escalation creates a smart layer that ensures high-value customers receive treatment proportional to their business importance.

1. **Real-Time Customer Value Recognition**: When a ticket arrives, COCO instantly identifies:
   - Account tier (ARR, contract value, strategic importance)
   - Renewal date proximity (accounts within 90 days of renewal get priority boost)
   - Account health score (NPS, product usage, support history)
   - Contact's role (executive contacts get different treatment than end users)
   - Expansion pipeline (accounts with active upsell opportunities)

2. **Intelligent Escalation Matrix**: COCO applies dynamic escalation rules:
   - **Tier 1 (Enterprise VIP)**: P1-P2 issues go directly to senior agent + immediate CSM notification. P3-P4 go to dedicated enterprise queue with 30-minute SLA.
   - **Tier 2 (Growth accounts)**: P1 gets immediate escalation. P2-P4 get priority queue placement.
   - **Renewal Risk**: Any account within 60 days of renewal gets automatic priority boost regardless of issue severity.
   - **Churn Signal Detection**: Language analysis flags tickets containing churn indicators.

3. **Context-Rich Agent Handoff**: When a VIP ticket is escalated, the agent receives:
   - Account summary (ARR, products, contract dates, key stakeholders)
   - Ticket history (recent issues, resolution patterns, satisfaction scores)
   - Relationship context (CSM notes, last executive meeting, known concerns)
   - Renewal/expansion context (upcoming renewal, active opportunities)
   - Recommended approach (based on account health and contact personality)

4. **Churn Signal Detection**: COCO analyzes ticket content for warning signs:
   - Direct signals: "cancel," "downgrade," "not renewing," "looking at alternatives"
   - Indirect signals: "frustrated," "this keeps happening," "not getting value," "executive team is asking"
   - Pattern signals: Increasing ticket frequency, escalating severity, shorter messages (disengagement)
   - Triggers automatic CSM alert with risk assessment

5. **Proactive Intervention**: Beyond reactive escalation, COCO enables:
   - Weekly VIP account health reports for CSMs
   - Automatic outreach triggers when usage drops below threshold
   - Sentiment trend analysis across all touchpoints
   - Early warning system for accounts showing pre-churn patterns

6. **Executive Communication Handling**: When C-level contacts submit tickets:
   - Immediate routing to most senior available agent
   - CSM and account manager notified within 5 minutes
   - Response drafted with executive-appropriate tone and detail level
   - Follow-up scheduled within 24 hours regardless of resolution

**Measurable Results**

- **VIP first-response time**: 12 minutes (vs. 2 hours standard)
- **VIP accounts churned due to support**: 0 (previous year: 4 accounts, $1.2M ARR)
- **VIP CSAT**: 94% (vs. 84% overall)
- **Churn signals detected and saved**: 11 at-risk accounts identified and retained ($2.8M ARR)
- **CSM proactive intervention rate**: From 23% to 78% of VIP issues
- **Enterprise renewal rate**: From 89% to 96%

**Who Benefits**

- **Enterprise Customers**: Feel valued and prioritized; issues resolved faster
- **Support Agents**: Clear priority guidance; pre-loaded context for VIP interactions
- **Customer Success Managers**: Early warning on at-risk accounts; data for proactive outreach
- **Revenue Leaders**: Protected enterprise revenue; higher renewal rates

## Practical Prompts

**Prompt 1: Build VIP Escalation Rules**
```
Design a VIP escalation framework for our support team.

Our customer tiers:
- Enterprise: $100K+ ARR, [X] accounts
- Mid-Market: $10K-$100K ARR, [X] accounts
- SMB: Under $10K ARR, [X] accounts

Current SLAs:
- P1: [X hours] first response
- P2: [X hours] first response
- P3: [X hours] first response

Design:
1. Escalation matrix: For each customer tier x priority level, define response SLA, agent tier, and notification rules
2. Auto-escalation triggers: Conditions that automatically bump priority
3. Churn signal keywords: Words/phrases that should trigger CSM alerts
4. Executive contact handling: Special rules for C-level contacts
5. Renewal proximity rules: How to adjust priority based on days-to-renewal
6. Metrics to track: KPIs that measure VIP support effectiveness
```

**Prompt 2: Analyze Account Risk from Support Interactions**
```
Analyze these recent support interactions for a key account and assess churn risk.

Account: [Company], $[X] ARR, renewal date: [date]
CSM: [name]
Account health score: [current score]

Recent support tickets (last 90 days):
1. Date: [X] | Issue: [X] | Priority: [X] | Resolution time: [X] | CSAT: [X]
2. Date: [X] | Issue: [X] | Priority: [X] | Resolution time: [X] | CSAT: [X]
[...continue]

Recent support excerpts (customer language):
[paste notable customer messages]

Analyze:
1. Churn risk level (Low/Medium/High/Critical) with reasoning
2. Pattern analysis: Is ticket frequency/severity increasing?
3. Sentiment trend: Is the customer becoming more frustrated over time?
4. Key concerns: What issues keep recurring?
5. Recommended actions for CSM (immediate, this week, this month)
6. Talking points for next CSM check-in call
```

**Prompt 3: Draft VIP Customer Apology and Recovery Email**
```
A VIP customer had a poor support experience. Draft a recovery email from their CSM.

Account: [Company], $[X] ARR
Contact: [Name], [Title]
What happened: [describe the support failure - e.g., long wait time, incorrect resolution, multiple transfers]
Customer's stated frustration: [paste their words if available]
Relationship history: [strong/strained/new]

Write an email that:
1. Acknowledges the specific failure (don't be vague)
2. Takes ownership without excuses
3. Explains what we're doing to fix the root cause (not just this instance)
4. Offers a concrete goodwill gesture appropriate to the relationship tier
5. Provides direct escalation path for future issues
6. Maintains dignity -- apologetic but not groveling

Tone: Senior, professional, genuine. This should sound like it comes from someone who genuinely cares about the relationship, not a PR template.
