::: details Pain Point & How COCO Solves It

**The Pain: Strategy Brief Is Draining Your Team's Productivity**

In today's fast-paced Consulting landscape, Consultant professionals face mounting pressure to deliver results faster with fewer resources. The traditional approach to strategy brief is manual, error-prone, and unsustainably slow.

Industry data shows that teams spend an average of 15-25 hours per week on tasks that could be automated or significantly accelerated. For Consultant teams specifically, this translates to delayed deliverables, missed opportunities, and rising operational costs.

The downstream impact is severe: decision-makers wait longer for critical insights, competitive advantages erode, and talented professionals burn out on repetitive work instead of focusing on strategic initiatives that drive real business value.

**How COCO Solves It**
