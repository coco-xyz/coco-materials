# Video Script: AI Feature Adoption Tracker
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "6 weeks to build. 3 months post-launch: 8% of users have ever tried it. The feature isn't broken — users who find it rate it positively. But adoption has flatlined. Was it discoverability? Activation friction? Wrong messaging? The wrong user segment entirely? Nobody knows."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows an underutilized feature adding UI complexity that slows all users, right side shows engineering time producing capabilities nobody accesses. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "Industry studies show 60-80% of SaaS features are 'rarely or never' used by the majority of users. Teams know adoption is low — they don't know if the problem is at discovery, first use, or recurring use. Without that answer, interventions are guesswork."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Adoption funnel mapping decomposing feature adoption from exposure through habitual use into 5 distinct stages — identifying which stage is the actual bottleneck
  - Segment-level adoption differential revealing which user personas, plan tiers, and acquisition channels adopt successfully vs. consistently drop off
  - Intervention recommendation engine generating targeted fixes per barrier with estimated adoption lift for each — ranked by expected impact
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Feature Adoption Tracker compresses adoption diagnosis from a 2-week analyst project to 4 hours — with 25-40% improvement in 90-day adoption rates after implementing identified barrier fixes."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "Mid-use abandonment rates down 30-45%. Expansion campaigns targeted at high-affinity segments achieve 2.8x better adoption than broad campaigns. Teams recover 15-25% of 'underperforming' features to strong adoption through targeted intervention — without rebuilding them."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
