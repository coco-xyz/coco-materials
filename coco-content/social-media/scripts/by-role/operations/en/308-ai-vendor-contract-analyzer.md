# #308 - AI Vendor Contract Analyzer — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Operations / Compliance
**Metric**: 9% revenue lost to poor contract management → 5–15% spend recovered

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: Operations manager signing a contract, fast-forward to a year later — auto-renewal charges appear on a finance report, software never used.
[Voiceover]: "That vendor contract you signed last year? It just auto-renewed — for software nobody uses."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Stack of vendor contracts, a calendar showing a renewal date buried in fine print, a legal clause highlighted in red on screen. Finance team reacts to unexpected charges.
[Voiceover]: "Poor contract management costs enterprises 9% of annual revenue. Auto-renewals, buried liability caps, data clauses that violate GDPR — they hide in plain sight, waiting for the moment you're not looking."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: User pastes a vendor contract into COCO. Risk flags appear highlighted — asymmetric liability clause, auto-renewal date with a 15-day notice window, missing data processing agreement. COCO produces a structured summary and negotiation talking points.
[Voiceover]: "Paste your vendor contract into COCO. It surfaces every risk flag — missing data agreements, unfair liability caps, renewal traps — then gives you a plain-language summary for leadership and negotiation talking points to push back on the vendor."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: Operations manager negotiating confidently with a vendor, renewal dates tracked on a clean dashboard, finance team reviewing favorable contract terms.
[Voiceover]: "Review contracts in 90 minutes, not 8 hours. Catch risk before it costs you — start at coco.xyz"
