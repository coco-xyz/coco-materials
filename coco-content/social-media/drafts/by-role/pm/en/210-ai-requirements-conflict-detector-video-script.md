# Video Script: AI Requirements Conflict Detector
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "Sales wants SSO. Security requires audit logging. Engineering flagged a database constraint. CS wants a self-serve flow. Legal needs consent checkpoints. Nobody in any of those conversations knows what the others said — and nobody read all six sets of notes looking for landmines."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows requirements from six teams in isolation, right side shows an engineer discovering a spec contradiction on day 5 of the sprint. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "Conflicts discovered during development — not before. Each discovery costs 1-2 days of engineering rework at minimum. Sprint velocity drops ~15% per quarter from spec changes. Only ~20% of cross-stakeholder conflicts are caught in manual review."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Cross-stakeholder requirement parsing normalizing inputs from meeting notes, Slack, email, and PRD comments into a unified requirements model
  - Conflict type classification categorizing contradictions, resource conflicts, priority conflicts, and dependency chains
  - Resolution option generation producing 2-3 resolution paths per conflict with trade-off analysis — structured for stakeholder alignment meetings
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Requirements Conflict Detector surfaces 70-80% of conflicts before sprint start — cutting mid-sprint rework by ~55% and alignment meeting time from 90 minutes to 40."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "Sprint velocity loss from spec changes drops from ~15% to under 5% per quarter. Cross-stakeholder dependency coverage goes from ~50% to 90%+ before sign-off. Post-launch spec disputes fall 40% — because conflicts are resolved before code is written."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
