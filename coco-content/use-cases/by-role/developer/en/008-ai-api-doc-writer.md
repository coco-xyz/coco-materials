# #8 - AI API Doc Writer

**Category**: Dev Team / Technical Writing
**Pain**: API docs are always outdated because nobody wants to write them — new endpoints ship without docs, and external devs waste hours guessing
**Solution**: COCO AI agent reads your codebase, generates complete API documentation with examples, and keeps it updated with every merge
**Metric**: 1 week of manual documentation → 2 hours

Our AI doc writer reads the codebase and generates full API docs in 2 hours. With examples.
