# #323 — AI Job Description Writer — Video Script (English)

**Category**: HR / Content
**Metric**: 3–5 hours per JD → under 30 minutes

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: HR manager staring at a blank document, cursor blinking, stack of sticky notes with bullet points scattered around
[Voiceover]: "Every open role starts the same way — a blank page and a deadline."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Calendar showing days blocked for "JD review," email threads with 12 replies, a job post with red markup from legal
[Voiceover]: "Writing a job description that actually attracts the right people takes 3 to 5 hours — and that's before legal red-lines it twice. Multiply that by 50 open roles, and your team is buried."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: HR professional typing a short brief into COCO, a polished JD appearing section by section, bias flags highlighted automatically
[Voiceover]: "Tell COCO the role, the team, and what great looks like. In seconds, you get a complete, on-brand job description — with bias flags built in. One prompt. Done."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: Job posting live on LinkedIn, applicant tracker filling with relevant candidates, hiring manager giving thumbs up
[Voiceover]: "85% faster JDs, better candidate quality, fewer legal rounds. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
