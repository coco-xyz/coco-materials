# #315 - AI Resource Allocation Optimizer — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Operations / Analysis
**Metric**: Intuition-based allocation → 20–35% improvement in on-time delivery

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: Operations manager staring at a spreadsheet trying to figure out who can take on a new project. Three people are overloaded, two are available but their skills are unclear.
[Voiceover]: "You have three projects starting next month. You have no idea who to put on what."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Projects stalling because the right person wasn't allocated. An overloaded star performer burning out. A skilled specialist sitting idle because nobody knew they were available. Leadership asking why delivery timelines keep slipping.
[Voiceover]: "Resource misallocation costs organizations millions in missed deadlines and burned-out talent. The data you need is scattered across HR systems, calendars, and manager intuition. Nobody can see the full picture — so nobody allocates optimally."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: Operations manager providing COCO with team inventory, project demands, and skill requirements. COCO generates a clear capacity view — overloaded in red, available in green. Scenario modeling: "If you put Sarah on Project A, Project B risks slipping 3 weeks. Here's the alternative." Skill gap flagged 8 weeks ahead.
[Voiceover]: "Give COCO your team inventory and project pipeline. It maps supply against demand, identifies overloads and idle capacity, models allocation scenarios with their tradeoffs, and flags skill gaps 8 weeks before they derail delivery."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: Project portfolio moving on track. Team workload balanced on screen. Operations manager making a confident resource decision in 20 minutes instead of 3 hours.
[Voiceover]: "35% better on-time delivery. Allocation decisions in minutes, not hours — optimize your resources at coco.xyz"
