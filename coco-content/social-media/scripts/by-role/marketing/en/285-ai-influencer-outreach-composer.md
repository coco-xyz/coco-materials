**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: Generic pitch email: "Hi [Creator Name], we love your content! We'd like to partner with you..." Response rate tracker showing 6%.
[Voiceover]: "73% of brand pitches show no evidence of actually watching the creator's content. They're mass-blasted copy-paste scripts — and creators can tell in 3 seconds. Your response rate reflects it: 6% industry average. You need 50 partnerships, you get 3."
