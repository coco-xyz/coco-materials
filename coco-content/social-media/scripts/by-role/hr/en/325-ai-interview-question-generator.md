**Category**: HR / Research
**Metric**: 4+ hours of prep → under 45 minutes per role

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: Hiring manager in an interview, visibly unprepared, asking "So... tell me about yourself" for the third time
[Voiceover]: "Asking the same three generic questions isn't interviewing. It's hoping."

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Split screen — different interviewers asking wildly different questions for the same role, candidate looking confused
[Voiceover]: "Without structured questions, interviews are inconsistent, biased, and barely predictive. Research shows unstructured interviews have half the predictive power of structured ones — yet most teams still wing it."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: HR typing role and competencies into COCO, a full interview guide appearing — behavioral questions, follow-up probes, scoring rubrics, legal flags
[Voiceover]: "Tell COCO the role and competencies. Get a complete structured interview guide — behavioral questions, scoring rubrics, legal compliance checks — in minutes. Every interviewer aligned. Every candidate assessed fairly."

---

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: Confident hiring manager leading a structured interview, candidates leaving looking engaged, team comparing evaluation scores
[Voiceover]: "55% better inter-rater consistency. 80% fewer legal risks. Better hires. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
