# Video Script: AI Security Incident Forensics Assistant
Duration: ~30 seconds
Style: Warm yellow color tone, COCO branding

## Scene 1 (0-5s): Hook
[Fade in. Bold text on warm yellow background. Subtle particle animation.]
Voiceover: "A security incident is simultaneously a technical crisis and a forensic investigation. Containment actions destroy evidence. Investigation takes time that lets damage spread. And the forensic data volume in a modern cloud-native environment — terabytes of logs, hundreds of thousands of network events — is simply beyond what a human analyst can process manually in the time available."

## Scene 2 (5-12s): Pain Point
[Split screen: left side shows an analyst manually reconstructing an attack timeline from fragmented log sources over weeks, right side shows a GDPR 72-hour notification deadline approaching with the report barely started. Numbers animate upward.]
Voiceover: "Manual forensic timeline reconstruction for complex security incidents takes 2-4 weeks. After containment, the team faces regulatory notification deadlines — GDPR's 72 hours, HIPAA's 60 days — legal evidence preservation requirements, and executive communication demands, all while exhausted from the response."

## Scene 3 (12-22s): Solution
[COCO logo appears. Smooth transition to dashboard mockup. Feature bullets animate in one by one.]
Key features:
  - Multi-source artifact analysis processing application logs, network captures, authentication events, file system changes, and cloud API audit logs (CloudTrail, GCP Audit, Azure Activity) with cross-source timestamp normalization
  - MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping identifying which tactics are present, suggesting what other activity to look for, and assessing threat actor sophistication
  - Structured forensic report generation covering the complete attack timeline, scope of compromise, IoC extraction, and regulatory notification draft for GDPR/HIPAA/PCI DSS
Voiceover: "COCO's AI Security Incident Forensics Assistant compresses forensic timeline reconstruction from 2-4 weeks of manual work to 12-24 hours — within regulatory deadlines, not after."

## Scene 4 (22-28s): Results
[Impact metrics animate with counting effect. Green upward arrows.]
Voiceover: "COCO identifies the actual start of incidents on average 72 hours earlier than manual analysis — revealing the full scope. Automated IoC extraction finds 3-5x more indicators than manual log review. Organizations with complete forensic reports see 60% lower incident recurrence rates — because the root cause is fully understood and remediated."

## Scene 5 (28-30s): CTA
[COCO logo centered. URL fades in below. Warm glow effect.]
Voiceover: "Visit coco.xyz"
