# #241 - AI User Persona Deep Builder — Video Script (English)

**Category**: Product Manager / Research
**Metric**: Persona cited in 22% of product decisions → 78% with behavior-grounded personas

---

**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**

[Visual]: A persona document labeled "Rachel the Resourceful Recruiter" — professionally formatted, with stock photo, bullet points about goals; then a PM in a meeting saying "so what would Rachel think about this API design?"... silence
[Voiceover]: "Your user personas look great in Confluence. Do they actually help you make a single product decision?"

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**

[Visual]: A persona doc dated 18 months ago; actual product analytics showing user behavior that looks nothing like the persona describes; a frustrated designer saying "but the persona says users care about speed, so why is everyone using the slow batch export?"
[Voiceover]: "Traditional personas are built from interviews — what users say they want. Real decisions need behavioral data — what users actually do. The average persona document is 18 months old, built from 5 interviews, and actively consulted in only 22% of product decisions. It's not a tool. It's a slide."

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**

[Visual]: COCO ingesting support ticket data, feature usage analytics, and interview transcripts, then producing a richly detailed persona with jobs-to-be-done, behavioral signatures, and specific decision guidance
[Voiceover]: "COCO builds personas from what users actually do — usage patterns, support tickets, session data, NPS verbatims — not just what they say in interviews. The output isn't a demographic profile. It's a decision tool: for this feature trade-off, here's what your highest-priority user needs, and here's the cost to other user types."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**

[Visual]: A product decision meeting where the PM references a specific persona finding to settle a feature debate; everyone nods
[Voiceover]: "Personas consulted in 78% of decisions. 3.2x more often cited in actual decision documentation. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
