**Scene 1 (0:00–0:10): Hook**
[Visual]: CSM staring at a yellow health score, three sub-scores, no idea what action to take
[Voiceover]: "The health score turned yellow. Now what?"

---

**Scene 2 (0:10–0:30): The Problem**
[Visual]: Junior CSM clicking through sub-scores, confused — "usage down, support ok, engagement low" — no clear story or action plan
[Voiceover]: "Health scores are only useful if you know what they mean. 66% of CSMs say they don't fully trust or act on their health scores — because nobody can explain them."

---

**Scene 3 (0:30–0:50): COCO in Action**
[Visual]: CSM pastes health score breakdown into COCO; a clear narrative appears — "this is a power-user concentration risk pattern, here's what's happening, here's what to do"
[Voiceover]: "Paste your health score data into COCO. Get a plain-English explanation of what the pattern means, what the customer is experiencing, and your next 3 actions — in 4 minutes."

**Scene 4 (0:50–1:00): The Result**
[Visual]: CSM confidently calling the customer with a clear agenda, health score moving from yellow to green over 30 days
[Voiceover]: "Health score utilization up to 81%. Churn on interpreted accounts: 6.2% vs 17.8%. Try COCO at coco.xyz"
