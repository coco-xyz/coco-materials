2. **"From 80 People to 5"** -- Coocaa case is shocking and memorable
3. **"AI Never Sleeps"** -- Adecco 51% after-hours, Klarna 24/7/35-languages
4. **"Revenue You're Leaving on the Table"** -- Salesforce SDR finding $1.7M in dead leads

## Competitor Landscape (from case studies)

| Competitor | Positioning | Notable Customers | Strength |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Lindy.ai** | "Your first AI employee" | TrueMed, Ankor, Blackbird | No-code agent builder, multiple agent types |
| **Salesforce Agentforce** | Enterprise AI agents | Reddit, Siemens, Adecco, 18,500 customers | CRM integration, enterprise trust |

## COCO Differentiation Opportunities

Based on case study analysis, COCO can differentiate by:

1. **Managed Service vs. DIY Platform** -- Most competitors (Lindy, Relevance AI) are platforms where you build agents. COCO provides a managed, ready-to-work AI employee. Like the difference between AWS (infrastructure) and hiring a DevOps contractor.

2. **Full-Stack AI Employee** -- While competitors specialize (Jasper=marketing, Agentforce=CRM), COCO can position as a general-purpose digital employee that handles tasks across functions.

3. **Chinese + Global Market** -- BetterYeah/iFlytek serve only China. Lindy/Jasper serve only West. COCO can bridge both markets.

4. **Human-in-the-Loop by Design** -- Many cases show AI handling 36-70% of tasks (not 100%). COCO's model of "managed AI employee with human supervision" matches real-world deployment patterns.

5. **SMB-First Pricing** -- Enterprise cases (Salesforce, Danfoss) require enterprise budgets. COCO can bring enterprise-grade AI employees to SMBs at accessible pricing.
